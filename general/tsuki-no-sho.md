> 寛永三年拾月日、さることありて、君之御前ヲ退テ、私ならず山にわけ入ぬれば、みつから世をのかるゝと人は云めれと、物うき山のすまひ、柴の庵りの風のみあれて、かけひならては、つゆ音ノウモノナシ。

In the tenth month of Kan'ei 3 (1626), certain circumstances led me to withdraw from service before my lord. It was not for selfish reasons, but when I entered the mountains, people said that I had turned my back on the world. In truth, in these melancholy mountains, only the wind disturbs my brushwood hermitage; were it not for the bamboo waterspout, even the dew would make no sound.

> 此世の外ハよそならし、侘ても至つれ〱、先祖の跡をたつね、兵法の道を学といへとも、習之心持やすからす、殊更此比は自得一味ヲあけて、名を付、習とせしかたはら多かりけれは、根本之習をもぬし〱が得たる方に聞請テ、門弟たりといへとも、二人の覚は二理と成て理さたまらす。

Here outside the world all seems a realm apart; austere as it may be, it has reached tedium. Walking in the footsteps of my ancestors, I have studied the martial arts, yet the true spirit of the pursuit is not easily attained. Especially lately, every man who achieves some fragment of understanding gives his name to it and calls it a "school" -- there are many such cases. Even having learnt the fundamentals from the teachers who themselves attained them, fellow disciples as though they may be, two men's realisation becomes two principles, and the Principle itself is left unsettled.

> さるにより、秀綱公より宗厳公、今宗矩公ノ目録ヲ取あつめ、ながれをうる其人々にとへは、かれは知り、かれは不ㇾ知、かれ知たるハ、則これに寄シ、かれ不ㇾ知ハ又知たる方ニテ是をたつねて書シ、聞つくし見つくし、大形習の心持ならん事ヲよせて書附ハ、詞にハいひものへやせむ、身に得事やすからす。

Therefore, gathering the transmission lists from Lord Hidetsuna through Lord Munetoshi and now Lord Munenori, I questioned those who had received the tradition. One knew, another did not. What one knew I took and added here; what another did not know I sought from those who did, and wrote it down. Having exhausted what could be heard and seen, I have compiled and written what seems to be the general spirit of the teaching. Yet to express it in words is not easily done, and to realise it in one's own body is harder still.

> 折ふし関東へひとゝせ下りしに、夏の稽古はしまりける寛永拾四年五月初日より、秋終に至テ是ヲ学、老父ノ相伝一々書留テ、此ヲ寄スル也。此左に寄シタル数々の習、重々の心持ヲ三ツにわけて、三つを亦ひとつに寄シテ予の得道とせり。

On one occasion I went down to the Kantō region for a year. From when the summer training began on the first day of the fifth month of Kan’ei 14 (1637) until the end of autumn I studied this art. My venerable father recorded each transmission in writing, and I drew upon these notes. The various teachings and the many states of mind gathered in this record I divided into three, and then united the three again into one, making this the path of my own attainment.

> 然とも、向ふまたかくのことく我にひとしくあらん敵ニハ、勝負いかんとも心得かたし。さるによつて、おもふその至極を一巻ニ述る。老父に捧ㇾ捧ハ父の云ク、これ不ㇾ残やき捨タランニしくハあらしと也。

Nevertheless, if faced with an adversary equal to myself, I could not tell whether I would win or lose. Therefore I have set down what I believe to be the ultimate principle in a single volume.　When I offered it in reverence to my venerable father, he said, "Perhaps you'd do best to burn all of this."
