# Tachi Yonhonme　太刀四本目

Uchidachi assumes hassō, and shidachi wakigamae. Both sides advance three smaller-than-usual steps. Upon reaching ma-ai, uchidachi, sensing an opportunity, raises the sword into morote-hidari-jōdan; shidachi immediately reciprocates, and both sides step forwards on the right foot to make a vigorous cut to the opponent's shōmen, leading to the swords cutting into a deadlock (*kirimusubi*) in *ai-uchi*.

Following the ai-uchi, both sides, displaying equal kigurai, scrape the blades' shinogi together to assume ai-chūdan. Uchidachi, sensing another opportunity, angles the edge to shidachi's left, and, stepping in leading with the right foot and following with the left, thrusts  with both hands aiming at shidachi's right lung.

Shidachi steps with the left foot to the front left and moves the right foot in behind the left, and performs a large *makikaeshi* to strike uchidachi's shōmen.

Uchidachi leading with the left foot and shidachi with the right, both sides return to ai-chūdan at the halfway point while displaying zanshin. Lowering the kensen to release the kamae, both sides return to their respective starting position.

## Overview

The fourth tachi kata is adapted from the [second kata](../butokukai/dainihon.md) of the earlier Butokukai kenjutsu kata, with two major changes. Firstly, shidachi's initial kamae was changed from seigan to wakigamae to conform with the *in'yō-gogyō* theory of Ittō-ryū. Secondly, the kesa cut to the neck was replaced with a vertical cut to the head since the neck is not a valid target area in modern kendō.

## Kamae and approach

In the second Butokukai kenjutsu kata, which served as a template for this form, uchidachi starts in hassō, but hassō had in a baffling move been renamed chūdan, presumably to fit into the *ten-chi-jin* trichotomy. However, in Ittō-ryū, hassō (or a lower, vertical, version of hassō) is known as *in no kamae*, and its opposite is wakigamae, *yō no kamae*. Furthermore, in the gogyō system, hassō is considered the kamae of wood, and its natural counterstance is the kamae of metal: wakigamae. For these reasons, it was natural to decide that shidachi should assume wakigamae in reaponse to uchidachi's hassō.

When approaching into ma-ai, it is explained that the steps are "slightly shorter" than usual. Although this is often explained as uchidachi being wary due to shidachi's sword being hidden and its length unknown, I believe it more likely that they are just matching the opponent's steps to meet in the centre[^1]. As for shidachi, they are in hanmi for wakigamae and simply cannot take longer steps.

# Ai-uchi

The distance in the current form of the ai-uchi is strange and difficult to get right. The footwork was inexplicably changed at some point[^2]: although it now says for both sides to step forwards with the right foot, the original text did not specify the footwork for shidachi. In old videos, however, shidachi brings the right foot in line with the left during furikaburi, and steps back with the left during the ai-uchi, effectively remaining in place but backing away from where uchidachi is aiming their cut. This makes much more sense, and the ma-ai will be naturally correct without uchidachi needing to adjust by stepping back afterwards[^3].

There is an explanatory note in the manual stating that for the ma-ai to work, both sides need to make large cuts, properly stretching out at the point when the blades make contact. The furikaburi is explained as being large enough for the opponent to ve visible between one's arms before the cut.

[^1]: And anyway, the saya would still be visible, giving an upper bound for the blade's length.

[^2]: Seemingly in 1981, with the publication of the modern-language version of the manual.

[^3]: I lack the authority to write what I think about such changes, so I will instead quote a senior teacher I hold in high esteem: "They think they know better than the masters in the committee? This is what I think of that: *$#@ you!"
