# Tachi Yonhonme　太刀四本目

Uchidachi assumes hassō, and shidachi wakigamae. Both sides advance three smaller-than-usual steps. Upon reaching ma-ai, uchidachi, sensing an opportunity, raises the sword into morote-hidari-jōdan; shidachi immediately reciprocates, and both sides step forwards on the right foot to make a vigorous cut to the opponent's shōmen, leading to the swords cutting into a deadlock in *kirimusubi*.
