# Tachi Yonhonme　太刀四本目

Uchidachi assumes hassō, and shidachi wakigamae. Both sides advance three smaller-than-usual steps. Upon reaching ma-ai, uchidachi, sensing an opportunity, raises the sword into morote-hidari-jōdan; shidachi immediately reciprocates, and both sides step forwards on the right foot to make a vigorous cut to the opponent's shōmen, leading to the swords cutting into a deadlock in *kirimusubi*.

Following the ai-uchi, both sides, displaying equal kigurai, scrape the blades' shinogi together to assume ai-chūdan. Uchidachi, sensing another opportunity, angles the edge to shidachi's left, and, stepping in leading with the right foot and following with the left, thrusts  with both hands aiming at shidachi's right lung.

Shidachi steps with the left foot to the front left and moves the right foot in behind the left, and performs a large *makikaeshi* to strike uchidachi's shōmen.

Uchidachi leading with the left foot and shidachi with the right, both sides return to ai-chūdan at the halfway point while displaying zanshin. Lowering the kensen to release the kamae, both sides return to their respective starting position.

The fourth tachi kata is adapted from the [second kata](../butokukai/dainihon.md) of the earlier Butokukai kenjutsu kata, with two major changes. Firstly, shidachi's initial kamae was changed from seigan to wakigamae to conform with the *in'yō-gogyō* theory of Ittō-ryū. Secondly, the kesa cut to the neck was replaced with a vertical cut to the head since the neck is not a valid target area in modern kendō.
