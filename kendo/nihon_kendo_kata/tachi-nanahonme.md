# Tachi nanahonme　太刀七本目

Uchidachi and shidachi both start in chūdan and advance into ma-ai. Uchidachi senses an opportunity and, stepping forwards lightly and turning the edge diagonally down to shidachi's left, makes a two-handed thrust sliding in along the shinogi to shidachi's chest area.

Shidachi, pulling their body back starting with the left foot in accordance with the length of uchidachi's advance, pushes both hands forwards as if thrusting while turning the edge diagonally  down to their own left, and uses the shinogi on the monouchi to support uchidachi's sword. This action will naturally cause both kensen to rise somewhat.

Both sides return to ai-chūdan with equal kigurai. Uchidachi steps in with the left foot, and while stepping forwards with the right foot makes a cut to shidachi's shōmen without regard for their own body.
