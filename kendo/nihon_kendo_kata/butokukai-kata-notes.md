# On the Butokukai kata

When the Butokukai's kendō kata creation committee first gathered in 1911, they set about the task of creating a set of kata for junior high-school kendō education using the existing [Butokukai seitei kenjutsu kata](../butokukai/README.md) as the base. The Butokukai kenjutsu kata had failed to reach widespread acceptance in large part due to the kata being too strongly influenced by a single ryūha (Shintō Munen-ryū). For this reason, the new committee wanted the new kata to capture the essence of kendō in a way that exponents of all schools could agree on, rather than representing one or a few ryūha. This would prove to be a more difficult task than anyone could have expected. At one point, Takano Sasaburō, known as the father of modern kendō, in sheer frustration over not having his opinions heard, brought a concealed tantō to the committee meeting "fully prepared to die". Ironically, his own Tōkyō Kōshi Gogyō no Kata ended up having the largest influence on the finished forms.
