# Tachi ropponme　太刀六本目

Uchidachi starting in chūdan and shidachi in gedan, both sides advance starting with the right foot. Upon reaching ma-ai, shidachi, sensing an opportunity, begins raising their kensen towards chūdan to threaten the centre point between uchidachi's hands. In response, meanwhile, uchidachi lowers their kensen a little, but when the swords are about to meet, retreats with the right foot to raise the sword into hidari-jōdan as they fail to subdue shidachi's threat.

Shidachi immediately follows with a big step in okuri-ashi, staying in chūdan but raising the kensen to threaten uchidachi's left fist in jōdan to project seme. Because of this threat, uchidachi immediately steps back with the left foot to assume chūdan, then, seeing an opportunity, makes a small cut aimed at shidachi's right wrist.

Shidachi, while stepping to the left with their left foot, performs suriage using the right (ura-) shinogi with the feeling of drawing a small semicircle with their sword, then strikes uchidachi's right wrist while stepping forwards with the right foot.

Uchidachi lowers their kensen (angling the edge diagonally to the right) and takes a large step diagonally backwards to their left, so shidachi steps forwards with their left foot and raises their sword into hidari-jōdan to display zanshin.

While raising their swords into ai-chūdan, both sides return to the centre point starting with the right foot, then lower their kensen and return to their respective starting point.

## Overview

This kata is probably adapted, at least in spirit, from [the third form](../butokukai/daisanbon.md) of the earlier Butokukai kenjutsu kata, but if so, not much of the original kata is recognisable today.

Firstly, since gedan is the counter-kamae of chūdan in the in'yō-gogyō system, and because shidachi consistently assumes the *yō* kamae in response to uchidachi's *in*[^1] in the tachi kata 4-6 (nanahonme being balanced in mutual chūdan), uchidachi's initial kamae was changed to chūdan.

Secondly, it no longer makes as much sense for uchidachi to retreat to wakigamae, as they are already in chūdan with shidachi's kensen threatening from below, and the following cut to the leg having been removed due to the leg not being a valid target in the new kendō system. Instead, they retreat into jōdan, and uchidachi follows and asserts control by moving into "hira-seigan". From here, the kata shows very strong influence from the Tōkyō Kōshi Gogyō no Kata, with shidachi's pursuit of uchidachi through different complementary kamae, the kote-suriage-kote with small techniques, and uchidachi's manner of retreat all being clearly recognisable from that set.

Although chūdan is a balanced kamae with equal amounts of *in* and *yō*, it is also adaptable and able to take on a stronger aspect in either direction depending on the opponent's kamae. This is why uchidachi's initial chūdan is considered an *in* kamae in opposition to shidachi's lower gedan, while shidachi's chūdan counters uchidachi's jōdan with a stronger *yō* aspect. Moreover, the kamae was not referred to as chūdan in the original edition of the manual, but always as seigan. Compared to the modern chūdan, seigan was slightly higher to project stronger seme to the eyes (hence the name), and therefore could be considered to tend a little to *in*. In hira-seigan, the kensen is even higher but projecting seme upwards at the opponent's hand, and this makes it a *yō* kamae in this context.

Here, the recurring pattern of joint moral and technical progress from the first three kata is again starting to become discernible: although the previous two kata ended with the (symbolic) death of uchidachi, now shidachi has progressed enough to achieve victory by only "lightly" injuring (as the small kote cut is not enough to sever the hand as in tachi nihonme) their enemy and subduing their fighting spirit to make them admit defeat.

## Seme

Shidachi applies very strong pressure from below towards uchidachi's hands while slowly raising the kensen from gedan, demonstrating why gedan is considered a counter to chūdan. Uchidachi tries to cover and press back against this seme, but ultimately fails. Instead of leaving an opening for shidachi to attack, they retreat into jōdan hoping to create an opening to themselves attack from there, but shidachi leaves no such gap in their kamae or distance, instead immediately following into an anti-jōdan chūdan at an uncomfortably (for uchidachi) close distance.

## Kote-suriage-kote

[^1]: A student using jōdan against a senior is considered very improper; Nakayama Hakudō once called it "the height of insolence". The *yō* aspect of upwards-attacking kamae is also considered more positive than the downwards-cutting *in* stances, so this symbolism is probably why shidachi is assigned *yō* kamae in these kata.
