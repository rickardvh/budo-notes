# Tachi gohonme　太刀五本目

Uchidachi assumes morote-hidari-jōdan, and shidachi chūdan. Both sides advance into ma-ai, and uchidachi, sensing an opportunity, steps forwards with the right foot to cut shidachi's shōmen.

Shidachi, stepping backwards leading with the left foot, performs *suriage* with the left (omote) shinogi, and steps forwards again leading with the right foot to cut uchidachi's shōmen. While stepping back with the right foot, shidachi raises their sword into hidari-jōdan to display zanshin.

When uchidachi begins to raise their kensen into chūdan, shidachi steps back with the left foot and lowers their own kensen to meet in ai-chūdan.
