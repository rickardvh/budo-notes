# Tachi gohonme　太刀五本目

Uchidachi assumes morote-hidari-jōdan, and shidachi chūdan. Both sides advance into ma-ai, and uchidachi, sensing an opportunity, steps forwards with the right foot to cut shidachi's shōmen.

Shidachi, stepping backwards leading with the left foot, performs *suriage* with the left (omote) shinogi, and steps forwards again leading with the right foot to cut uchidachi's shōmen. While stepping back with the right foot, shidachi raises their sword into hidari-jōdan to display zanshin.

When uchidachi begins to raise their kensen into chūdan, shidachi steps back with the left foot and lowers their own kensen to meet in ai-chūdan. Uchidachi starting with the left foot and shidachi with the right, both sides take three small steps to return to the centre, then lower their kensen and return to their respective starting location.

## Overview

This kata was developed from [the first form](../butokukai/daiippon.md) of the Butokukai kenjutsu kata, although there is not much left of the original today. Uchidachi's attack was changed from a diagonal cut to the upper arm to a vertical cut to the head because the upper arm is not a valid target in modern kendō, and because of this, their sword is not in a position for shidachi to perform uchiotoshi and follow up with a tsuki. Instead, shidachi directly makes a decisive shōmen cut.
