# Tachi sanbonme　太刀三本目

Uchidachi and shidachi both start in gedan no kamae and advance starting with the right foot. Upon reaching ma-ai, both raise their kensen under a battle of wills until naturally reaching ai-chūdan. Uchidachi, sensing an opportunity, turns the sword edge slightly to shidachi's left to make a two-handed thrust to shidachi's solar plexus by stepping forwards on the right foot and sliding on the shinogi around shidachi's sword.

Shidachi, taking a big step back leading with the left foot in order to pull the body back and away from the incoming thrust, presses uchidachi's sword lightly down and to the side with the shinogi of their own sword's monouchi area in *nayashi-ire*, and returns the thrust to uchidachi's chest.

Upon having their attack returned, uchidachi steps back with the right foot and brings their sword below and around shidachi's sword, and with slightly extended arms brings their kensen in front of shidachi's throat to press their sword to the right with the monouchi shinogi. The body is facing forwards with the left foot in front.

Shidachi presses on with another step, this time with the left foot, in *kuraizume* with the feeling of thrusting. Having no choice but to back again, uchidachi steps back with the left foot and brings the sword below and around shidachi's sword to press it to the left with the monouchi shinogi. However, uchidachi is subdued by shidachi's kigurai and is forced to lower their kensen while retreating starting with the left foot. Without hesitation, shidachi continues in kuraizume, taking three small steps in quick succession starting with the right foot while raising their kensen to between uchidachi's eyes.

Uchidachi starting with the right foot and shidachi with the left, both sides return to the centre while returning to ai-chūdan. From awase, both sides lower their kensen to release their kamae, and return to their respective starting position.

## Controlling the centre

The third kata teaches the principle of the centre (中心 chūshin) and how to control it. As uchidachi reaches chūdan slightly earlier than shidachi, they find an opening in that shidachi's centre is unguarded. Exploiting this opening, they thrust while using the curvature of the sword to reach around shidachi's sword to target the suigetsu[^1] (solar plexus), keeping the kensen in the centre. The lesson for shidachi lies in steering the tsuki off centre while themselves retaining control of the centre, and then to achieve victory by asserting control of the centre despite uchidachi's attempts to regain it.

## Nayashi-ire

Shidachi's defence against uchidachi's tsuki is described as 入れ突きに萎やす (*irezuki ni nayasu*), and the technique is generally referred to as *nayashi-ire* (萎やし入れ), meaning to make something wilt by pulling it in. The full description can be translated as "with the monouchi's shinogi, lightly make uchidachi's blade wilt in an inwards thrust"[^2]. One sometimes sees this technique performed similarly to the defensive counterthrust in nanahonme, but there is no forwards thrust. Rather, one backs away from the sword, leaving the hands in place until the left foot has completed its step, then pulling the sword in towards oneself as the right foot follows. Uchidachi's sword is made to "wilt" (a very fitting description) by turning the edge to the bottom right, thus lightly pressing the blade down and aside with the shinogi of the monouchi. It is only necessary to push the kensen just outside the line of the body, and it is essential that both hands remain completely centred to keep control of the centre. This is very easy - just turn the palm of the right hand to face down as the sword is pulled in. Then, the thrust can be instantly returned by angling the edge back down and applying tenouchi while stepping forwards.

## Kuraizume

## The sword of valour

[^1]: I have heard people say the thrust is to the lung or heart and that uchidachi angles the blade to enter between the ribs, but they were getting the kata mixed up. It is absolutely vital to the kata that the thrust is to the suigetsu, as it is in the centre of the body.
