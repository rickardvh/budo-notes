# Dai-Nippon Butokukai Seitei Kenjutsu Kata

The Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kendō Kata (later the [Nihon Kendō Kata](../nihon_kendo_kata/README.md)) were not the first attempt by the Butokukai at creating a set of common sword forms. Already in December 1906, three kata called the *Dai-Nippon Butokukai Seitei Kenjutsu Kata* (大日本武徳会制定剣術形) were announced by a committee of seven high-ranking members led by Watanabe Nobori-hanshi of Shintō Munen-ryū. However, they were never widely promulgated due to dissatisfaction with unresolved arguments within the committee, the feeling being that Watanabe had used his influence to push decisions without sufficient discussion.

Each of the three Butokukai kenjutsu kata was based on one of the three parts of the universe: Heaven (天, *ten*), represented by jōdan; Earth (地, *chi*), represented by chūdan[^1]; and Humanity (人, *jin*), represented by gedan. The same philosophical metaphor can be seen in the three kata later created by the Ministry of Education and Culture and included as the first three forms of the current kendō kata.
