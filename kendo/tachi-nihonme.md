# Tachi Nihonme

Uchidachi and shidachi start in chūdan, and advance together starting with the right foot. The moment ma-ai is entered, uchidachi, sensing an opportunity, strikes at shidachi's right kote. The cut stops slightly below the wrist.

Shidachi steps back to the rear left diagonal leading with the left foot, while dropping the kensen with a feeling of drawing a half circle under uchidachi's sword, thereby evading the cut. Taking a big step forwards with the right foot in okuri-ashi, shidachi makes a large cut to uchidachi's right kote.

Uchidachi steps leading with the left foot, and shidachi with the right while showing zanshin with strong kigurai, back to the centre position to make awase in ai-chūdan. Lowering the kensen to release their kamae, both return to the starting positions.

## Centre line

One thing stands out as odd in this kata: uchidachi attempts to cut kote by cutting vertically down the centre, basically right along shidachi's sword. Even in the best case, the cut would hit the tsuba. A kote strike normally requires one to get slightly off the centre line to get around the opponent's sword, or the strike is performed at an oblique angle to reach the kote.
