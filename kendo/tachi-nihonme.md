# Tachi Nihonme

Uchidachi and shidachi start in chÅ«dan, and advance together starting with the right foot. The moment ma-ai is entered, uchidachi, sensing an opportunity, strikes at shidachi's right kote. The cut stops slightly below the wrist.

Shidachi steps back to the rear right diagonal leading with the left foot in okuri-ashi.
