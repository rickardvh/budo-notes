# Nihon Kendo Kata
Much of the information about the kendo kata its taken from the now-defunct blog [はくどー庵](https://hakudoh.com/%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8/) (Hakudō-an). Since that blog has been "under construction" since July 2023, and only the table of contents preserved in the Internet Archive, most of it is written from memory. If anyone has access to the articles on kendō kata by Hakudō-an, I would be very grateful to be able to read them again.
