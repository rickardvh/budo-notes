# Preface to the Shinkage-ryū hyōhō list of transmissions　新陰流兵法目録　序

> 関長老作

*By the Elder Kan*[^1]

> 夫兵術者、保身、亡敵、斉家、治軍、制国、平天下之道也。

The martial arts is the way by which one preserves oneself, vanquishes the enemy, brings the household into order, governs the army, rules the realm, and brings peace to all under Heaven.[^2]

> 庶人得之則保身、勇士得之則亡敵。

When the common man attains it, he preserves himself; when the warrior attains it, he destroys his enemy.

> 大夫得之其斉家。戦将得之則治軍。諸候得之則制国。天子得之平二天下。

When the gentleman attains it, he orders his household; when the general attains it, he governs his army; when the lord attains it, he rules his realm; when the Son of Heaven attains it, he brings peace to all under Heaven.

> 以戦止戦之意也。是故銃(鋭)士勇将、欲立威珍天下者、無不由兵術。

It is the principle of using war to end war. Therefore, the valiant warrior and the brave commander — all who would establish their authority under Heaven — must rely upon the martial arts.

[^1]: The identity of this Elder Kan (関長老 *Kan-chōrō*) is uncertain, but he was a Rinzai Zen elder, possibly Takuan Sōhō himself.

[^2]: This passage is a reference to a famous line in Confucius's book The Great Learning (大學):「修身、齊家、治國、平天下」. It describes the ladder of ethical priorities with which a ruler should be concerned: better yourself, bring your household into order, rule the realm, and bring peace to all under Heaven.
