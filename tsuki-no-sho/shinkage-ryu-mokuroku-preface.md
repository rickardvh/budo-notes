# Preface to the Shinkage-ryū hyōhō list of transmissions　新陰流兵法目録　序

> 関長老作

*By the Elder Kan*[^1]

> 夫兵術者、保身、亡敵、斉家、治軍、制国、平天下之道也。

The martial arts is the way by which one preserves oneself, vanquishes the enemy, brings the household into order, governs the army, rules the realm, and brings peace to all under Heaven.[^2]

> 庶人得之則保身、勇士得之則亡敵。

When the common man attains it, he preserves himself; when the warrior attains it, he destroys his enemy.

> 大夫得之其斉家。戦将得之則治軍。諸候得之則制国。天子得之平二天下。

When the gentleman attains it, he orders his household; when the general attains it, he governs his army; when the lord attains it, he rules his realm; when the Son of Heaven attains it, he brings peace to all under Heaven.

> 以戦止戦之意也。是故銃(鋭)士勇将、欲立威珍天下者、無不由兵術。

It is the principle of using war to end war. Therefore, the valiant warrior and the brave commander — all who would establish their authority under Heaven — must rely upon the martial arts.

> 而兵術之要、莫大珍必克彼此相対、臨下欲交鋒接刃端皈彼可以来我可以往。彼人也。我人也。

Now, as for the essence of the martial art, there is nothing greater than this: when he and I face each other, on the verge of crossing blades, he may come and I may go. He is a man; I am a man.

> 蜂蠆猶有毒、況於人乎。而又兵不両勝、不両負。強弱所分、生死所罹、危之至也。可不慎乎。

Even bees and scorpions possess venom; how much more so human beings. And moreover, in battle, both sides cannot win, and both sides cannot lose. Where strength and weakness are decided, where life and death come to bear, danger is at its extreme. How could one not be cautious?

[^1]: The identity of this Elder Kan (関長老 *Kan-chōrō*) is uncertain, but he was a Rinzai Zen elder, possibly Takuan Sōhō himself.

[^2]: This passage is a reference to a famous line in Confucius's book The Great Learning (大學):「修身、齊家、治國、平天下」. It describes the ladder of ethical priorities with which a ruler should be concerned: better yourself, bring your household into order, rule the realm, and bring peace to all under Heaven.
