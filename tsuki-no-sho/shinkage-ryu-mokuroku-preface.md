# Preface to the Shinkage-ryū hyōhō list of transmissions　新陰流兵法目録　序

> 関長老作

*By the Elder Kan*[^1]

> 夫兵術者、保身、亡敵、斉家、治軍、制国、平天下之道也。

The martial arts is the way by which one preserves oneself, vanquishes the enemy, brings the household into order, governs the army, rules the realm, and brings peace to all under Heaven.[^2]

> 庶人得之則保身、勇士得之則亡敵。

When the common man attains it, he preserves himself; when the warrior attains it, he destroys his enemy.

> 大夫得之其斉家。戦将得之則治軍。諸候得之則制国。天子得之平二天下。

When the gentleman attains it, he orders his household; when the general attains it, he governs his army; when the lord attains it, he rules his realm; when the Son of Heaven attains it, he brings peace to all under Heaven.

> 以戦止戦之意也。是故銃(鋭)士勇将、欲立威珍天下者、無不由兵術。

It is the principle of using war to end war. Therefore, the valiant warrior and the brave commander — all who would establish their authority under Heaven — must rely upon the martial arts.

> 而兵術之要、莫大珍必克彼此相対、臨下欲交鋒接刃端皈彼可以来我可以往。彼人也。我人也。

Now, as for the essence of the martial art, there is nothing greater than this: when he and I face each other, on the verge of crossing blades, he may come and I may go. He is a man; I am a man.

> 蜂蠆猶有毒、況於人乎。而又兵不両勝、不両負。強弱所分、生死所罹、危之至也。可不慎乎。

Even bees and scorpions possess venom; how much more so human beings. And moreover, in battle, both sides cannot win, and both sides cannot lose. Where strength and weakness are decided, where life and death come to bear, danger is at its extreme. How could one not be cautious?

> 于此時欲決勝於白刃之前、則自非得剣闘之妙術者、豈能得必勝之利乎。

At such a moment, if one seeks to decide victory before bared blades, then unless one has truly attained the subtle art of sword-fighting, how could one possibly gain the advantage of certain victory?

> 仮令雖有人膂力迥人、如抜山扛鼎、陸地盪舟。亦不得剣術者、必為敵所捿。

Even if a man's physical strength far surpassed that of others — able to uproot mountains, hoist cauldrons, or move boats upon dry land — if he has not attained the art of the sword, he will inevitably fall to the enemy.

> 仮令雖有人持于如将・莫耶・大阿・竜泉、天下之妙剣、亦不得剣術者、必為敵所檎者也。昔荆軻為秦王被誅者是也。故史記云、荆軻惜不講刺剣之術。

Even should a man bear in his hand the finest swords under Heaven — *Ganjiang*, *Moye*, *Tai'a*, and *Longquan* — if he has not attained swordsmanship, he will surely become the prey of the enemy. In ancient times, Jing Ke, who was slain by the King of Qin, is an example of this. For as the *Records of the Historian* say: "Jing Ke’s regret was that he had not studied the art of the thrusting sword."

> 大史公亦貴剣術如此。楚項羽学剣不成曰、剣一人敵、不足学、我学万人敵。此言似是非者乎。不能学一人敵、豈能学万人敵。

The Grand Historian[^3] likewise held swordsmanship in high esteem. Xiang Yu of Chu once studied the sword but did not master it, saying:
"The sword is for facing one man — not worth learning. I shall learn how to face ten thousand." Yet is this not a saying that seems right but is wrong? If one cannot learn to face a single man, how could one possibly learn to face ten thousand?

> 一人万人、多寡雖異、至亡敵道者一也。項王身死国亡、取笑於天下者亦宜哉。

Whether one faces a single man or ten thousand, though the numbers differ, the Way of overcoming the enemy is one and the same. Xiang Yu lost his life and brought his state to ruin, becoming a laughingstock to all under Heaven — this too was only fitting.

[^2]: This passage is a reference to a famous line in Confucius's book The Great Learning (大學):「修身、齊家、治國、平天下」. It describes the ladder of ethical priorities with which a ruler should be concerned: better the self, bring the household into order, govern the realm, and bring peace to all under Heaven.
