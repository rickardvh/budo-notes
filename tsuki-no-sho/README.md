# Tsuki no shō　月之抄

The *Tsuki no shō* (月之抄) or Reflections[^1] on the Moon by the legendary swordsman Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi is one of the most famous classical works on swordsmanship.

The source text is taken from 史料柳生新陰流（下巻） (Historical records of Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, vol. 2) (April 1995, pp. 9-80), edited by Imamura Yoshio.

[^1]: 抄 (*shō*) means "excerpts" or "annotations" — "reflections" sounds better to me in English.
