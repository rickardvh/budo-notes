# Ukenagashi[^1]

From the starting position, turn to face the right and sit down in seiza. The enemy, who is seated some distance[^2] away to your left, stands up, draws their sword, and approaches to cut you with a vertical cut from above.

## Standing up and parrying

Look at the enemy as they rise from seiza, and quickly place both hands on the sword. Note the difference in wording compared to the previous two kata, where you place your hands "quietly" on the sword -- rather than attempting to deescalate the situation[^3], you react to a sudden threat. Without hesitation, raise your hips and the toes of the right foot. While extending the hips, step to the inside of the right knee with the left foot, angling the foot slightly outwards. The manual goes on to say that one should be drawing the sword close to one's chest while standing up. This was previously interpreted as drawing upwards as early as possible, almost scraping the floor with the kojiri while raising the hips. However, this has since been clarified as meaning to leave the sword in the horizontal position -- only releasing the habaki and drawing about a hand's width -- while stepping with the left foot, and then to draw directly upwards while standing up. There is no time to be saved by drawing partway earlier, and if anything the ukenagashi technique benefits from a faster draw. More importantly, the right hand must not draw too far forwards: the purpose of the initial short draw is only to bring the hand to where it must be in order to end up on the line of the right shoulder at the final position by drawing straight upwards. This position is not past the left knee right before standing up. If the hand moves straight upwards from this position relative to the body, the simultaneous rotation of the upper body will ensure the correct parrying position with the shortest possible trajectory of the draw. No additional thinking required.

[^1]: 受け流し: "parrying and deflecting"
[^2]: Usually taken to be 3-5 metres, but in any event far enough that they will have to stand up in order to approach and attack.
[^3]: By escalating it into the enemy's face until they see the error of their ways.
