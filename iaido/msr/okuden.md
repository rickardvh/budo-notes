## Introduction

The formal name of Okuden is *Battō kokoromochi no koto* (抜刀心持之事): "the mental attitude of sword-drawing". It is also referred to as *Okuiai*, *Eishin-ryū ura*/*oku*, or simply *Jūshin-ryū*. In the densho, it is introduced with the following passage:

>> 格を放れて早く抜く也　重信流
>
> *Free yourself from the rules and draw quickly*  
> *Jūshin-ryū*

Traditionally, Okuden would be taught only once the student had learnt Ōmori-ryū, Eishin-ryū, Tachiuchi no kurai, Tsumeai no kurai, Daishōzume and Daishō tachizume. Going back even further, the various forms did not start out as actual kata at all, but as instructions on how to act in specific situations in which one might find oneself during the course of duty. Most of the kata in the later *Battō kokoromochi no koto* were adapted from entries in the *Soto no mono no daiji* (外之物之大事 "outside essentials"; teachings outside the core curriculum of the school) and the *Jōi no daiji* (上意之大事 "essentials of acting under orders"; instructions for situations that may arise when on a mission) to work as training methods for daily practice. For this reason, although practising the forms will aid in developing speed and technique, without the correct background and knowledge of the scenarios they were originally meant to instruct on, such practice amounts to little more than pointless sword-swinging.

Adding to the confusion, the Okuden that has been passed down in Musō Shinden-ryū has been greatly distorted and the kata names jumbled over time. Although Musō Shinden-ryū is usually regarded as belonging to the Shimomura line of Tosa Eishin-ryū, this is not entirely correct when it comes to Okuden. The Okuden of Musō Shinden-ryū is probably that which Nakayama Hakudō learnt from Morimoto Tokumi of the Tanimura (Gotō) line, which is why it is nearly identical to that of Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū. The true Shimomura line as transmitted from Hosokawa Yoshimasa was passed down by Nakayama only to a select few students, first of whom was Kimura Eiju, under the name [Musō Shinden Jūshin-ryū](../msjr/README.md).

Unfortunately, while the densho of the Shimomura line have been published, only the [Kongen no maki](../msjr/iai-kongen-no-maki.md) has ever come out of the Tanimura line, and it appears its teachers have not had access to the old scrolls since the split. While the Shimomura-ha densho were eventually published in the 1970s, it was already too late as forms and interpretations had calcified, and few teachers actually read the old texts. Making matters worse, the kata names had been rearranged in the Tanimura line, with many forms assigned misleading names originally belonging to unrelated entries in the *Jōi no daiji* and other sections. Later on, with no access to the actual texts, teachers attempted to reconcile the names with the forms, resulting in confusing interpretations that in some cases are far removed from the original scenarios. Although this renaming and rearrangement of Okuden is usually attributed to Ōe Masaji, there is no clear evidence that he did not pass it on as inherited from Gotō Masasuke. Indeed, if Nakayama's Okuden is the one he learnt from Morimoto (himself a student of Gotō), the changes may have happened earlier.

## Seated forms

居業（座業）

### 霞 Kasumi

Meaning: "haze" or "mist"  
Traditional name: 向拂 *Mukōbarai* ("sweep/clear in front")

The name Kasumi may have borrowed from the *Soto no mono no daiji*, where it describes a detached, "dreamlike" state of mind, in which one perceives the enemy as through a haze. It was paired with the secret technique Raiden (雷電, "thunder and lightning") where one invites the enemy to attack and cuts their hand on the tsuka as they move to do so. These two concepts are described as the innermost of the inner secrets; the very foundation of the school.

### 脛囲 Sunegakoi

Meaning: "protecting the shin"  
Traditional name: 柄留 *Tsukadome* ("stopping (with) the tsuka")

In the traditional form, one uses the tsuka to press the enemy's sword hand down and stop the draw; as they instead step back and draw from below to cut the leg, one continues as in Tora-issoku. Sunegakoi leaves the first part out, resulting in a form essentially identical to Tora-issoku.

### 四方切 Shihōgiri

Meaning: "cuts in four directions"  
Traditional name: 四角 *Shikaku* ("square"/"four corners")  
Other names: 四角 *Yosumi*, *Shisumi* ("four corners")

The name Shihōgiri appears in one of the old mokuroku directly following the core Eishin-ryū forms. It is unclear to me what exactly it refers to there, but it appears to be a small set of four kata: 向 (opposite), 右 (right), 左 (left), and 後 (behind).

The important lesson of this kata, which comes from instructions in the *Jōi no daiji*, is that one will not have time to deeply cut each enemy in turn, and that iai relies on "shallow" victory. In order to keep all four enemies at bay precisely long enough to cut all of them in quick succession, the essential action is to make a large sweeping circular cut the moment the kissaki leaves the saya, rotating to the right until reaching the enemy to the rear. Exploiting the opening caused by the instinctive shying away of the enemies, one can then cut each of them with quicker-than-usual cuts, not trying to make fully committed cuts. The positioning of the enemies was later rotated 45°, and the instructions were combined with [Ryōzume (Towaki)](#戸脇-towaki) to incorporate a thrust to the rear left enemy before the sweep.

### 戸詰 Tozume

Meaning: "caught in the door"  
Traditional name: 両詰 *Ryōzume* ("pressed on both sides")  
Other names: 三角 *Sankaku* ("triangle"/"three corners")

Originally, this form dealt with the scenario where you have an enemy close by on both sides, such as when you are sent as an envoy and the guards move to seize you. [Towaki](#戸脇-towaki) was the base form, as it is faster first to thrust to the left before cutting to the right, compared to cutting each enemy in turn. However, if you think the enemy to the right may stop you from drawing, it is prudent to cut him before turning to the one on the left: this kaewaza became Tozume. The positioning of the enemies was changed from directly to the sides to diagonally to the front right and left.

Sankaku is another kata completely, where you have one enemy in front and two behind.

As for the name, Tozume comes from an entry in the *Jōi no daiji*, instructing on what to do if you fear the enemy might slam the sliding door shut on your head as you bow in the doorway upon entering a room; in this situation, you should place a folding fan in the door groove in the floor and hold it down with your knee while bowing, in order to block the door.

### 戸脇 Towaki

Meaning: "beside the door"  
Traditional name: 両詰 *Ryōzume* ("pressed on both sides")

See [Tozume](#戸詰-tozume). The enemies' positions were again shifted from directly to the sides to diagonally to the front right and rear left. Musō Shinden Eishin-ryū in the Hosokawa tradition has a similar kata called Zengozume (前後詰) with one enemy directly in front and another directly behind; Towaki can be considered an in-between version of Zengozume and the original Ryōzume.

The name Towaki again comes from the *Jōi no daiji*, where it contains instructions on how to enter a room when you suspect an enemy might be hiding to the side of the door waiting to ambush you: enter through the door with one decisive step directly towards where you think the enemy is standing, and pull the sword out together with the saya, using the tsuka to push him back with a strike to the chest, before drawing and thrusting at the staggered enemy. In the case that the enemy has already drawn his sword and cuts down the moment you enter, first block the cut with the tsuba near the fuchigane, the sword still in the saya.

### 棚下 Tanashita

Meaning: "under the shelf"  
Traditional name: 棚下 *Tanashita*

Tanashita was another entry in the *Jōi no daiji* detailing how to cut when vertical space is limited, such as under a low ceiling. The oldest version in the *Eishin-ryū iai mokuroku hiketsu* said simply to lower one knee to the floor at the moment of cutting, and that once one has understood this, one would also be able to cut without needing to lower the knee. This latter way of cutting is likely what is used in the modern [Mon-iri](#門入-mon-iri) to avoid cutting into the doorframe.

### 両詰（向詰） Ryōzume (Mukōzume)

Meaning: "pressed on both sides" (Ryōzume); "pressed in front" (Mukōzume)  
Traditional name: 向詰 *Mukōzume*

The name Ryōzume originally referred to [Towaki](#戸脇-towaki), where one has an enemy on both sides; hence the name. This was reinterpreted in the Gotō (Tanimura) line to mean "obstructed on both sides", and assigned to this form. In fact, as the original name Mukōzume implies, the scenario is that the enemy is seated close opposite to you, and there is not enough space in front to do a horizontal nukitsuke like in Yokogumo (and perhaps no space behind to step back as in the kaewaza). Instead, you draw the sword and bring it between yourself and the enemy, horizontally so as to (I presume) control the enemy's sword hand and stop him from drawing his own sword, and follow with a tsuki to the solar plexus as he attempts to back away.

### 虎走 Torabashiri

Meaning: "tiger run"  
Traditional name: 虎走 *Torabashiri*

This form, too, has its origin in the *Jōi no daiji*, and concerns how to execute a kill order on someone in a large room with other people present: stand up, hunch over with your sword pressed close in front so as to seem non-threatening, and walk (not running, despite the name) briskly with your knees close together straight to your target without hesitation. Once in range, draw the sword with the edge down within the line of your body, the purpose being to conceal the draw for as long as possible so as not to alert the nearby enemies, and cut gyaku-kesa, followed by a vertical downwards cut. If you are pursued when retreating, you can apply the same method for going backwards and defending yourself.

## Standing forms

立業

### 行連 Yukizure

Meaning: "brought along"  
Traditional name: 行連 *Yukizure*

Similarly to the relationship between [Tozume](#戸詰-tozume) (of which this is the standing form) and [Towaki](#戸脇-towaki), this was originally a kaewaza of what is now [Tsuredachi](#連達-tsuredachi). The enemies were positioned directly to the sides, and in the basic form one would draw and thrust at the enemy to the left before cutting the enemy to the right. However, an additional note added that one could also cut the enemy to the right with a one-handed cut before cutting the one to the left; this version became the Yukizure of Gotō-ha and later Musō Shinden-ryū. This entry was first included in the *Soto no mono no daiji*, and contained instructions on what to do in the event that enemies try to bring you away by coming from both sides at once.

### 連達 Tsuredachi

Meaning: "escorted away"  
Traditional name: 行連 *Yukizure*
Other names: 連達 *Rentatsu*

See [Yukizure](#行連-yukizure). The name Tsuredachi traditionally belonged to [Yukichigai](#行違-yukichigai).

### 惣捲 Sōmakuri

Meaning: "completely and repeatedly"  
Traditional name: 五方切 *Gohōgiri* ("cuts in five directions")  
Other names: 追いかけ斬 *Oikakegiri* ("pursuing and cutting")

Although the corresponding form in the Shimomura line is called Gohōgiri, the original entry in the *Soto no mono no daiji* is actually named Sōmakuri. It describes swinging and cutting "inexhaustably in vertical and horizontal directions", for which reason it is also referred to as Katajū (形十; "cross-shape"); there is a variant by this name in Musō Shinden Jūshin-ryū. According to the *Soto no mono no daiji*, Sōmakuri was performed in regular practice by cutting gradually lower from the neck, shoulder, waist, and shin, before finally making a downwards vertical cut.

[Oikakegiri](#追掛斬-oikakegiri) is another kata entirely.

### 総留 Sōdome

Meaning: "complete stopping"  
Traditional name: 放打 *Hanashiuchi* ("release-strike")

Sōdome, on the surface, is difficult to make sense of. There are many contrived explanations as for why one would repeatedly cut and sheathe the sword while walking without performing chiburi in between, but most agree on the following points regarding the scenario:

- You are walking on a narrow path without space to move sideways, such as on a wooden bridge.
- The time is usually stated to be at night.
- The enemies are coming one by one from the front; earlier descriptions more specifically state the front right.

No obviously corresponding entries appear in the older densho, and the kata first appears in the *Battō kokoromochi no koto* with the following terse description: "while walking, cut with one hand and sheathe, then cut again; no limit on the number of repetitions." There is, however, one note left by Soda Torahiko under the entry for 手之内 (*te no uchi*) in a later copy of the *Jōi no daiji*. In earlier explanations, *te no uchi* is a technique for taking control of the centre by pressing down on the enemy's hand and following through with a thrust when crossing swords, but in this particular version, it is (perhaps mistakenly due to a mixup) described only as "cut down the enemy (切り捨て) and keep walking", and the note adds "this is probably Sōdome".

Although some later lines perform Sōdome by cutting at the leg and ducking low, the older way of doing it is to cut the torso with kesagiri while lightly dropping the hips for stability. The original name Hanashiuchi implies that the essential point of the form is to draw and cut in one motion. It can fairly safely be assumed that the repeated cuts are a practice method added at a later stage, as commented by Masaoka Katsutane:

> The scenario for Sōdome is: at the instant you meet the opponent, you draw and cut kesagiri, then snap the blade back into the scabbard and pass on by. To give this movement a more formal "shape", you repeat the draw-cut several times, and at the end, just like in other kata, you open the blade to the right and finish by sheathing.

If that is the case, how does the "narrow path" affect the shape of the kata? Why is it relevant that it takes place during the night? Movement is not as visibly constrained as in Kabezoe, and with the target in the earliest versions being to the front right, there appears to be at least enough space for two people to walk side by side. There is also no special consideration given to lighting conditions, unlike in Shinobu. Since these oral traditions have been passed down in multiple lines, however, they must have had some relevance to the original form.

My theory is as follows: the scenario is that you purposely arrange to pass the enemy on a narrow bridge or other location where he is forced to pass close to you, customarily on the right so as to avoid saya clashing. Using this opportunity, you draw and cut in a quick surprise attack, and, without stopping, sheathe while walking on so as not to arouse suspicion from distant onlookers. This must be done at night to keep the risk of detection to a minimum, as it would be difficult in low-light conditions to identify you or tell from a distance what transpired until you have already left the scene.

It may be unrelated, but in the 真傳流居合極秘書 (*Shinden-ryū iai gokuhisho*), there are instructions for how to quickly cut someone down without being seen by the public eye: draw and cut in a surprise attack, then hide the sword as-is under your haori, and sheathe the sword once you have retreated to a place out of sight.

### 信夫 Shinobu

Meaning: ("in stealth")  
Traditional name: 夜之太刀 *Yoru no tachi* ("sword in the night")  
Other names: 夜の敵 *Yoru no teki* ("enemy in the night")

The name *Yoru no tachi* first appears in the *Battō heijutsu shinshin kanyō no daiji* (抜刀兵術真心肝要之大事; "the most important essentials of the true heart of sword-drawing"), where it is more correctly translated as "nighttime sword-fighting". It suggests wearing white clothing or slipping off one's kimono to expose the white juban underneath so as better to see the enemy's sword and judge the situation and distance more clearly. A low guard is recommended, as is aiming for the enemy's legs; it is also suggested to feint by suddenly dropping low to make the enemy think one has fallen over, and then to sweep at their legs.

### 行違 Yukichigai

Meaning: "passing by"  
Traditional name: 連達 *Tsuredachi*

### 袖摺返 Sodesurigaeshi

Meaning: "flipping the sleeve"  
Traditional name: 人中 *Jinchū* ("among people")  
Other names: 賢の事 *Katame no koto* ("regarding hardening")

### 門入 Mon-iri

Meaning: "entering through a gate"  
Traditional name: --  
Other names: 隠れ捨 *Kakuresute* ("hiding and discarding")

### 壁添 Kabezoe

Meaning: "along walls"  
Traditional name: 抜打 *Nukiuchi* ("surprise attack"/"drawing and striking")  
Other names: 人中 *Jinchū*

### 受流 Ukenagashi

Meaning: "deflecting (a cut)"  
Traditional name: 弛抜 *Yuruminuki* ("slack draw")

### 暇乞 Itomagoi

Meaning: "requesting leave"  
Traditional name: --  
Other names: 抜打 *Nukiuchi*
