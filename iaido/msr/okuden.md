## Introduction

The formal name of Okuden is *Battō kokoromochi no koto* (抜刀心持之事): "the mental attitude of sword-drawing". It is also referred to as *Okuiai*, *Eishin-ryū ura*/*oku*, or simply *Jūshin-ryū*. In the densho, it is introduced with the following passage:

>> 格を放れて早く抜く也　重信流
>
> *Free yourself from the rules and draw quickly*  
> *Jūshin-ryū*

Traditionally, Okuden would be taught only once the student had learnt Ōmori-ryū, Eishin-ryū, Tachiuchi no kurai, Tsumeai no kurai, Daishōzume and Daishō tachizume. Going back even further, the various forms did not start out as actual kata at all, but as instructions on how to act in specific situations in which one might find oneself during the course of duty. Most of the kata in the later *Battō kokoromochi no koto* were adapted from entries in the *Soto no mono no daiji* (外之物之大事 "outside essentials"; teachings outside the core curriculum of the school) and the *Jōi no daiji* (上意之大事 "essentials of acting under orders"; instructions for situations that may arise when on a mission) to work as training methods for daily practice. For this reason, although practising the forms will aid in developing speed and technique, without the correct background and knowledge of the scenarios they were originally meant to instruct on, such practice amounts to little more than pointless sword-swinging.

Adding to the confusion, the Okuden that has been passed down in Musō Shinden-ryū has been greatly distorted and the kata names jumbled over time. Although Musō Shinden-ryū is usually regarded as belonging to the Shimomura line of Tosa Eishin-ryū, this is not entirely correct when it comes to Okuden. The Okuden of Musō Shinden-ryū is probably that which Nakayama Hakudō learnt from Morimoto Tokumi of the Tanimura (Gotō) line, which is why it is nearly identical to that of Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū. The true Shimomura line as transmitted from Hosokawa Yoshimasa was passed down by Nakayama only to a select few students, first of whom was Kimura Eiju, under the name [Musō Shinden Jūshin-ryū](../msjr/README.md). Another line of the Shimomura-ha survives as Musō Shinden Eishin-ryū through Hosokawa's other student Ueta Heitarō.

Unfortunately, while the densho of the Shimomura line have been published, only the [Kongen no maki](../msjr/iai-kongen-no-maki.md) has ever come out of the Tanimura line, and it appears its teachers have not had access to the old scrolls since the split. While the Shimomura-ha densho were eventually published in the 1970s, it was already too late as forms and interpretations had calcified, and few teachers actually read the old texts. Making matters worse, the kata names had been rearranged in the Tanimura line, with many forms assigned misleading names originally belonging to unrelated entries in the *Jōi no daiji* and other sections. Later on, with no access to the actual texts, teachers attempted to reconcile the names with the forms, resulting in confusing interpretations that in some cases are far removed from the original scenarios. Although this renaming and rearrangement of Okuden is usually attributed to Ōe Masaji, there is no clear evidence that he did not pass it on as inherited from Gotō Masasuke. Indeed, if Nakayama's Okuden is the one he learnt from Morimoto (himself a student of Gotō), the changes may have happened earlier.

As garbled as the transmission may have become, however, one must not forget that a koryū is a living tradition that is shaped by each of the teachers who have passed it down to the present day. It would therefore be wrong to say that what we are taught is incorrect because it is different from the old tradition, and it is our responsibility to practise and pass it on as we are taught. With this in mind, however, it is also our responsibility to learn and understand where that tradition comes from and why and how it evolved into what it is now. So much is at danger of being forgotten and lost, and this proud and venerable school deserves our best efforts to understand it at a deeper level. In the case of Okuden, this understanding begins with the realisation that the forms are not merely kata, but teach important lessons on how to survive various dangerous situations Edo-period samurai might have expected to find themselves in; in doing so, the kata preserve an intangible piece of the culture iai sprung from.

## Seated forms

居業（座業）

### 霞 Kasumi

Meaning: "haze" or "mist"  
Traditional name: 向拂 *Mukōbarai* ("sweep/clear in front")

The name Kasumi may have borrowed from the *Soto no mono no daiji*, where it describes a detached, "dreamlike" state of mind, in which one perceives the enemy as through a haze. That Kasumi, however, is unrelated to this kata, which was originally called Mukōbarai and is first attested in the *Battō kokoromochi no koto*.

Danzaki Tomoaki (and possibly others) taught that the scenario of this kata is that you have two enemies in front, and cut one in nukitsuke before turning the sword over and cutting the other one in the return stroke — this is obviously nonsense. Although there is no explanation anywhere in the densho, it is otherwise universally agreed that the enemy evades the first cut, wherefore you advance and cut again to the left. Since this is the case, it is important to make nukitsuke without the prior plan of making a return cut. Nukitsuke is variously thought of as being across the chest, to the face, or to the neck; the return cut is usually to the neck, but it is also possible to aim for the raised right knee.

An interesting application of the same technique is in the kata Gaiseki from Daikendori, where uchidachi tries to cut first the right knee of the approaching shidachi, then (unsuccessfully) the left knee on the return cut as shidachi steps back to evade.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 脛囲 Sunegakoi

Meaning: "protecting the shin"  
Traditional name: 柄留 *Tsukadome* ("stopping (with) the tsuka")

In the traditional form, one uses the tsuka to press the enemy's sword hand down and stop the draw; as they instead step back and draw from below to cut the leg, one continues as in Tora-issoku. Sunegakoi leaves the first part out, resulting in a form essentially identical to Tora-issoku.

I once heard that *sune* ("shin") was used in the Tosa dialect about the knee as well as the lower leg; the wording in the *Jōi no daiji* entry for [Tanashita](#棚下-tanashita) seems to confirm this, as it refers to what must be the knee by this word.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 四方切 Shihōgiri

Meaning: "cuts in four directions"  
Traditional name: 四角 *Shikaku* ("square"/"four corners")  
Other names: 四角 *Yosumi*, *Shisumi* ("four corners")

The name Shihōgiri appears in one of the old mokuroku directly following the core Eishin-ryū forms. It is unclear to me what exactly it refers to there, but it appears to be a small set of four kata: 向 (opposite), 右 (right), 左 (left), and 後 (behind).

The important lesson of this kata, which comes from instructions in the *Jōi no daiji*, is that one will not have time to deeply cut each enemy in turn, and that iai relies on "shallow" victory. In order to keep all four enemies at bay precisely long enough to cut all of them in quick succession, the essential action is to make a large sweeping circular cut the moment the kissaki leaves the saya, rotating to the right until reaching the enemy to the rear. Exploiting the opening caused by the instinctive shying away of the enemies, one can then cut each of them with quicker-than-usual cuts, not trying to make fully committed cuts. The positioning of the enemies was later rotated 45°, and the instructions were combined with [Ryōzume (Towaki)](#戸脇-towaki) to incorporate a thrust to the rear left enemy before the sweep.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 戸詰 Tozume

Meaning: "caught in the door"  
Traditional name: 両詰 *Ryōzume* ("pressed on both sides")  
Other names: 三角 *Sankaku* ("triangle"/"three corners")

Originally, this form dealt with the scenario where you have an enemy close by on both sides, such as when you are sent as an envoy and the guards move to seize you. [Towaki](#戸脇-towaki) was the base form, as it is faster first to thrust to the left before cutting to the right, compared to cutting each enemy in turn. However, if you think the enemy to the right may stop you from drawing, it is prudent to cut him before turning to the one on the left: this kaewaza became Tozume. The positioning of the enemies was changed from directly to the sides to diagonally to the front right and left.

Sankaku is another kata completely, where you have one enemy in front and two behind.

As for the name, Tozume comes from an entry in the *Jōi no daiji*, instructing on what to do if you fear the enemy might slam the sliding door shut on your head as you bow in the doorway upon entering a room; in this situation, you should place a folding fan in the door groove in the floor and hold it down with your knee while bowing, in order to block the door.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 戸脇 Towaki

Meaning: "beside the door"  
Traditional name: 両詰 *Ryōzume* ("pressed on both sides")

See [Tozume](#戸詰-tozume). The enemies' positions were again shifted from directly to the sides to diagonally to the front right and rear left. Musō Shinden Eishin-ryū in the Hosokawa tradition has a similar kata called Zengozume (前後詰) with one enemy directly in front and another directly behind; Towaki can be considered an in-between version of Zengozume and the original Ryōzume.

The name Towaki again comes from the *Jōi no daiji*, where it contains instructions on how to enter a room when you suspect an enemy might be hiding to the side of the door waiting to ambush you: enter through the door with one decisive step directly towards where you think the enemy is standing, and pull the sword out together with the saya, using the tsuka to push him back with a strike to the chest, before drawing and thrusting at the staggered enemy. In the case that the enemy has already drawn his sword and cuts down the moment you enter, first block the cut with the tsuba near the fuchigane, the sword still in the saya.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 棚下 Tanashita

Meaning: "under the shelf"  
Traditional name: 棚下 *Tanashita*

Tanashita was another entry in the *Jōi no daiji* detailing how to cut when vertical space is limited, such as under a low ceiling. The oldest version in the *Eishin-ryū iai mokuroku hiketsu* said simply to lower one knee to the floor at the moment of cutting, and that once one has understood this, one would also be able to cut without needing to place the knee on the floor.

In modern Musō Shinden-ryū, influenced by the Tanimura line, the scenario of Tanashita is usually imagined to be drawing from tatehiza and coming out from under a crawl space or similarly very cramped place before cutting down. Although this scenario exists as a variant in the traditional Shimomura-ha (as does the standing version related above), the oral tradition adds one crucial element: before exiting the crawl space, one should sweep horizontally at the enemy to afford oneself the time to get out.

The standard version in the two current lines of Shimomura-ha emphasises cutting in a vertically constrained space, rather than just exiting from one before cutting. As such, the important point is to make a very compact cut while still leaning forwards to the point of touching the right thigh with the upper body, and only straightening up again once the sword clears the ceiling.

With this background, one cannot help but wonder what the purpose of practising the current Musō Shinden-ryū Tanashita is, other than learning how to crawl forwards with the sword on one's back.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 両詰（向詰） Ryōzume (Mukōzume)

Meaning: "pressed on both sides" (Ryōzume); "pressed in front" (Mukōzume)  
Traditional name: 向詰 *Mukōzume*

The name Ryōzume originally referred to [Towaki](#戸脇-towaki), where one has an enemy on each side; hence the name. This was reinterpreted in the Gotō (Tanimura) line to mean "obstructed on both sides", and assigned to this form. In fact, as the original name Mukōzume implies, the scenario is that the enemy is seated close opposite to you, and there is not enough space in front to do a horizontal nukitsuke like in Yokogumo (and perhaps no space behind to step back as in the kaewaza). Instead, you draw the sword and bring it between yourself and the enemy, horizontally so as to (I presume) control the enemy's sword hand and stop him from drawing his own sword, and follow with a tsuki to the solar plexus as he attempts to back away.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 虎走 Torabashiri

Meaning: "tiger run"  
Traditional name: 虎走 *Torabashiri*

This form, too, has its origin in the *Jōi no daiji*, and concerns how to execute a kill order on someone in a large room with other people present: stand up, hunch over with your sword pressed close in front so as to seem non-threatening, and walk (not running, despite the name) briskly with your knees close together straight to your target without hesitation. Once in range, draw the sword with the edge down within the line of your body, the purpose being to conceal the draw for as long as possible so as not to alert the nearby enemies, and cut gyaku-kesa, followed by a vertical downwards cut. If you are pursued when retreating, you can apply the same method for going backwards and defending yourself.

## Standing forms

立業

### 行連 Yukizure

Meaning: "brought along"  
Traditional name: 行連 *Yukizure*

Similarly to the relationship between [Tozume](#戸詰-tozume) (of which this is the standing form) and [Towaki](#戸脇-towaki), this was originally a kaewaza of what is now [Tsuredachi](#連達-tsuredachi). The enemies were positioned directly to the sides, and in the basic form one would draw and thrust at the enemy to the left before cutting the enemy to the right. However, an additional note added that one could also cut the enemy to the right with a one-handed cut before cutting the one to the left; this version became the Yukizure of Gotō-ha and later Musō Shinden-ryū. This entry was first included in the *Soto no mono no daiji*, and contained instructions on what to do in the event that enemies try to bring you away by coming from both sides at once.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 連達 Tsuredachi

Meaning: "escorted away"  
Traditional name: 行連 *Yukizure*
Other names: 連達 *Rentatsu*

See [Yukizure](#行連-yukizure). The name Tsuredachi traditionally belonged to [Yukichigai](#行違-yukichigai).

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 惣捲 Sōmakuri

Meaning: "completely and repeatedly"  
Traditional name: 五方切 *Gohōgiri* ("cuts in five directions")  
Other names: 追いかけ斬 *Oikakegiri* ("pursuing and cutting")

Although the corresponding form in the Shimomura line is called Gohōgiri, the original entry in the *Soto no mono no daiji* is actually named Sōmakuri. It describes swinging and cutting "inexhaustably in vertical and horizontal directions", for which reason it is also referred to as Katajū (形十; "cross-shape"); there is a variant by this name in Musō Shinden Jūshin-ryū. According to the *Soto no mono no daiji*, Sōmakuri was performed in regular practice by cutting gradually lower from the neck, shoulder, waist, and shin, before finally making a downwards vertical cut.

There is no explanation anywhere in the densho for the scenario of Sōmakuri. However, there is a very short passage mentioning the name in the *Iai heihō gokui hiketsu* (居合兵法極意秘訣), written by the tenth headmaster Hayashi Yasudayū Masakusu. Writing down what his adoptive father, the ninth headmaster Hayashi Rokudayū Morimasa, told him many years before, he mentions among other things that when doing Sōmakuri: "you should cut with one hand and then grasp with the left hand. Balance is crucial." While this is interesting in and of itself, what makes it particularly noteworthy is that Morimasa seems to have been talking about Shinkage-ryū (which he learnt from Ōmori Rokurōzaemon Masamitsu). The fact that Sōmakuri first appeared in the *Soto no mono no daiji* supports the conjecture that it is the very same thing brought into the school from outside, as *soto no mono* refers to things from outside the core curriculum, such as from other schools.

While I can find no form or technique listed by that name in current Shinkage-ryū mokuroku, there is a record in the *Tokitsugu-kyō-ki* (言継卿記; the court diary of Yamashina Tokitsugu) from the 23rd day of the fifth month of the first year of Genki (1570) relating the following:

>> 上泉武蔵守信綱来。軍敗取向総捲等、令相伝之。
>
> Kamiizumi Musashi-no-kami Nobutsuna \[the founder of Shinkage-ryū\] came. He transmitted *Gunbai*, *Torimuki*, ***Sōmakuri***, and the like.

In the *Yagyū-ryū shinpishō* (柳生流新秘抄), there is finally an explanation in the *Tengushō* (天狗抄) chapter of a method for fighting four or five enemies at once: in order not to allow them to surround you, when they come at you from a distance, you should pick one and, closing the distance to him, let loose with repeated strikes from all directions, paying no heed to what happens on your left or right, so as to push him back and break the circle. This method is called 總南風 ("the total south wind"), but the reading is given as *sōmakuri*.

[Oikakegiri](#追掛斬-oikakegiri) is another kata entirely.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 総留 Sōdome

Meaning: "complete stopping"  
Traditional name: 放打 *Hanashiuchi* ("release-strike")

Sōdome, on the surface, is difficult to make sense of. There are many contrived explanations as for why one would repeatedly cut and sheathe the sword while walking without performing chiburi in between, but most agree on the following points regarding the scenario:

- You are walking on a narrow path without space to move sideways, such as on a wooden bridge.
- The time is usually stated to be at night.
- The enemies are coming one by one from the front; earlier descriptions more specifically state the front right.

No obviously corresponding entries appear in the older densho, and the kata first appears in the *Battō kokoromochi no koto* with the following terse description: "while walking, cut with one hand and sheathe, then cut again; no limit on the number of repetitions." There is, however, one note left by Soda Torahiko under the entry for 手之内 (*te no uchi*) in a later copy of the *Jōi no daiji*. In earlier explanations, *te no uchi* is a technique for taking control of the centre by pressing down on the enemy's hand and following through with a thrust when crossing swords, but in this particular version, it is (perhaps mistakenly due to a mixup) described only as "cut down the enemy (切り捨て) and keep walking", and the note adds "this is probably Sōdome".

Although some later lines perform Sōdome by cutting at the leg and ducking low, the older way of doing it is to cut the torso with kesagiri while lightly dropping the hips for stability; the draw seems to have become gradually lower over time to make it faster. The original name Hanashiuchi implies that the essential point of the form is to draw and cut in one motion. It can fairly safely be assumed that the repeated cuts are a practice method added at a later stage, as commented by Masaoka Katsutane:

> The scenario for Sōdome is: at the instant you meet the opponent, you draw and cut kesagiri, then snap the blade back into the scabbard and pass on by. To give this movement a more formal "shape", you repeat the draw-cut several times, and at the end, just like in other kata, you open the blade to the right and finish by sheathing.

If that is the case, how does the "narrow path" affect the shape of the kata? Why is it relevant that it takes place during the night? Movement is not as visibly constrained as in Kabezoe, and with the target in the earliest versions being to the front right, there appears to be at least enough space for two people to walk side by side. There is also no special consideration given to lighting conditions, unlike in Shinobu. Since these oral traditions have been passed down in multiple lines, however, they must have had some relevance to the original form.

My theory is as follows: the scenario is that you purposely arrange to pass the enemy on a narrow bridge or other location where he is forced to pass close to you, customarily on the right so as to avoid saya clashing. Using this opportunity, you draw and cut in a quick surprise attack, and, without stopping, sheathe while walking on so as not to arouse suspicion from distant onlookers. This must be done at night to keep the risk of detection to a minimum, as it would be difficult in low-light conditions to identify you or tell from a distance what transpired until you have already left the scene.

It may be unrelated, but in the 真傳流居合極秘書 (*Shinden-ryū iai gokuhisho*), there are instructions for how to quickly cut someone down without being seen by the public eye: draw and cut in a surprise attack, then hide the sword as-is under your haori, and sheathe the sword once you have retreated to a place out of sight.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 信夫 Shinobu

Meaning: ("in stealth")  
Traditional name: 夜之太刀 *Yoru no tachi* ("sword in the night")  
Other names: 夜の敵 *Yoru no teki* ("enemy in the night")

The name *Yoru no tachi* first appears in the *Battō heijutsu shinshin kanyō no daiji* (抜刀兵術真心肝要之大事; "the most important essentials of the true heart of sword-drawing"), where it is more accurately translated as "nighttime sword-fighting". It suggests wearing white clothing or slipping off one's kimono to expose the white juban underneath so as better to see the enemy's sword and judge the situation and distance more clearly. A low guard is recommended, as is aiming for the enemy's legs; it is also suggested to feint by suddenly dropping low to make the enemy think one has fallen over, and then to sweep at their legs.

A related entry from the *Gokui no daiji* (極意之大事; "essentials of the inner teachings") is 地獄捜 (*jigokusagashi*; "searching through Hell"); a method for searching for an enemy hiding in pitch darkness. It consists of pulling out the sword with the saya, drawing the blade so that around three sun (~9 cm) remains in the saya, and quietly sweeping the surrounding area to probe with the kojiri. When you feel something, quickly draw the blade out and thrust.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 行違 Yukichigai

Meaning: "passing by"  
Traditional name: 連達 *Tsuredachi*

The name Yukichigai originally referred to [Ryōshi-hikitsure](#両士引連-ryōshi-hikitsure); as you dont "pass by" anyone in this Yukichigai, it is difficult to understand the reasoning behind the renaming. Tsuredachi was an entry under the *Soto no mono no daiji*, covering the scenario where two enemies — for example, robbers during travel — try to bring you away by walking in front and behind you. In this situation, you should strike the enemy in front with the tsukagashira on the back of the head, then draw and cut in the moment you turn to the rear, before turning back and cutting the first enemy. In current Musō Shinden-ryū, the scenario is usually thought of as enemies approaching from the front and back, and the target of the tsuka strike as being between the eyebrows or the philtrum.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 袖摺返 Sodesurigaeshi

Meaning: "flipping the sleeve"  
Traditional name: 人中 *Jinchū* ("among people")  
Other names: 賢の事 *Katame no koto* ("regarding hardening")

This form first appeared in the *Battō kokoromochi no koto*. The name Sodesurigaeshi was borrowed from the first kata of [Daishō tachizume](../msjr/README.md#daishō-tachizume), but as the original name Jinchū implies, the scenario is fighting in a thick crowd. For this reason, there being no space in any direction, one needs to draw the sword straight up along the left side of the body, although in most lines of Musō Shinden-ryū this part has been forgotten, and the draw is done forwards instead. Having drawn the sword, it was originally brought around to the right and along the extended right arm so as to avoid cutting innocent bystanders as one parts the crowd and steps in to cut. However, while many lines now teach to hold the sword upright for the same reason (although this could also be risky), many others inexplicably place the sword along the left arm instead, running a great risk of cutting bystanders when parting the crowd.

Nōtō was traditionally performed inside the body width by placing the back ridge of the blade on the shoulder and sheathing vertically, but if there is no risk of hurting the surrounding crowd, it can be done normally.

The alternative name *Katame no koto* (or *Ken no koto*) appears in the *Battō kokoromochi no koto* after the list of kata that are now practised. There is no information about it anywhere, but it does not appear to be an actual kata, as it is listed together with more general strategies. The kanji 賢 actually means "clever", but the reading is given as *katame* ("hardening"), so it should be taken as a miswriting of 堅. However, 賢之事 ("the matter of the clever") is a term from classical Chinese literature, where it instructs a ruler to promote the worthy despite the risk of them being more capable than and overthrowing the ruler himself. If I had to guess what the name means here, I would say that, given the surrounding context, it is probably the same as *tachikatame* (太刀堅; "securing the sword"), a method for binding the sword to the waist when wearing armour.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 門入 Mon-iri

Meaning: "entering through a gate"  
Traditional name: --  
Other names: 隠れ捨 *Kakuresute* ("hiding and discarding"/"coming out of hiding")

Mon-iri is a new form from the Tanimura-ha, and does not exist as a kata in Shimomura-ha or the *Battō kokoromochi no koto*. The name, however, comes from the *Jōi no daiji*. There, it describes a method for entering through a gate when you expect someone to cut at you the moment you exit on the other side: take out the sword with the saya and strap it to your back with the sageo, holding it in place by pulling the end of the sageo with the left hand; crouch down by leaning forwards and run through the gate; as the enemy cuts down on the sword on your back, cut at his legs with your wakizashi. There is also a similar strategy in the *Gokui no daiji* called *Shishidō-iri* or *Shishihora-iri* (獅子洞入; "entering the lion's den"), where you draw the sword and hold it along your back while swinging the wakizashi with the other hand.

The name Kakuresute might be based on *Kukurisute* (クゝリ捨; "tying up and discarding"), another "extra" entry following the kata list in *Battō kokoromochi no koto*. As with Katame no koto, there is no explanation of Kukurisute anywhere in the densho, however.

[**Top**](#okuden-okuiai)

### 壁添 Kabezoe

Meaning: "along walls"  
Traditional name: 抜打 *Nukiuchi* ("surprise attack"/"drawing and striking")  
Other names: 人中 *Jinchū*

Kabezoe is an entry in the *Jōi no daiji* instructing on how to fight in a narrow alley or other places with similarly obstructed sides. Ironically, given the kata that would later take its name, it stresses that if one tries to cut in such a place, one will invariably hit the walls, overhangs or lintels. Instead, one should draw within the line of the body by twisting sideways, and rely on thrusting techniques.

The scenario for Nukiuchi is described as encountering an enemy while walking along a narrow, confined space such as an alley, and seizing the initiative by drawing and cutting before the enemy. Some annotated versions of the *Battō kokoromochi no koto* are more specific, saying that because movement is constrained in all four directions, one has to draw straight up along the left side of the body as the feet are brought together, in the same way as in [Jinchū](#袖摺返-sodesurigaeshi). Nōtō should also be done as in Jinchū, meaning over the shoulder so as to keep the blade within the width of one's body.

Adding to this, oral tradition states that the cut needs to be performed without extending the elbows completely forwards, so as to avoid cutting into the "wall" behind the enemy. Several things about this explanation always struck me as odd:

- It seems highly unlikely that you would unexpectedly encounter an enemy with his back already against another wall, as you are walking down a narrow alley.
- If you are pursuing the enemy until his back is against a wall, why would you not draw earlier?
- If you can control the distance by pursuing the enemy, why would you deliberately position yourself so close that you cannot do a normal cut?
- The instructions in the *Jōi no daiji* specifically say not to cut when you are constrained by walls on both sides.

With this in mind, and the fact that the movements in this form are nearly identical to Jinchū apart from the parting of the crowd, I believe Danzaki Tomoaki not to be entirely wrong in referring to Kabezoe as Jinchū. Most likely, one started out as a kaewaza of the other, the difference being whether you spot the enemy through the crowd, or only notice him as you literally bump into each other on a busy street with people all around you.

### 受流 Ukenagashi

Meaning: "deflecting (a cut)"  
Traditional name: 弛抜 *Yuruminuki* ("slack draw")

At first glance, there does not appear to be much to add about this form; it first appears in the *Battō kokoromochi no koto* under the name *Yuruminuki*, referencing the relaxed grip necessary for ukenagashi, and ukenagashi techniques are, after all, ubiquitous in kenjutsu. However, on closer inspection, the phrasing in the oldest description is not entirely unambiguous and may not match the current technique in every respect:

>> 如前歩み行敵ゟ先に打を躰を少し開き弛して抜に切る也
>
> While walking as before (*i.e.* in [Jinchū](#壁添-kabezoe)), the enemy strikes first; **evade by opening up the body slightly, then draw and cut**.

There is no mention of ukenagashi anywhere, and the main point is evading (弛し *hazushi*; note that this kanji is the same as *yurumi* in the kata name) the cut by opening the body. The same wording is used in the old [Kodachi no kurai](../msjr/README.md#kodachi-no-kurai) to describe evasion by stepping back or to the side without deflecting the cut, while ukenagashi is referenced as such. Therefore, it is not unthinkable that 弛抜 was originally meant to be read *Hazushinuki* ("evasion draw"), but was later changed into an ukenagashi technique and the reading updated to the current *Yuruminuki*. It is worth noting here that there exists a kaewaza where one opens up to the right while drawing to evade the cut, and simultaneously cuts the enemy's left wrist or forearm from below as he cuts down.

### 暇乞 Itomagoi

Meaning: "requesting leave"  
Traditional name: 抜打　上・中・下 *Nukiuchi jō/chū/ge*

The scenario of Itomagoi is usually explained as being attacked by surprise (*nukiuchi*) during a seated bow to someone of lower, equal, or higher rank, and responding with ukenagashi and returning the cut. However, it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone would have bowed like that while wearing a sword, particularly a long sword, as it would have been a serious breach of etiquette. The current three kata should therefore be taken as pure practice forms, or at most as representing a "but what if?" scenario.

There is, however, an entry by the name *Itomagoi* in the *Gokui no daiji*:

> When you have been ordered to deal with someone, go to that person's place and make small talk about this and that; in the midst of that, you should cut them down.
> If there is no opening, take your sword and, saying "I'll come again soon" as you rise to leave, push them over with the kojiri, then immediately draw and thrust.
> Or, when the host sees you out and comes out with you, watch for that momentary opening, knock them down with the kojiri, then immediately draw and thrust.

## Additional forms

(These forms are only practised in a few lines)

### 両士引連 Ryōshi-hikitsure

Meaning: "accompanied by both men"/"bringing both men along"  
Traditional name: 行違 *Yukichigai*

Although the basic form as practised today consists of slashing the enemy's side while passing him, the original instructions for Yukichigai in the *Jōi no daiji* specifically stated that cutting while passing someone is bad. Instead, it says, one should draw the sword while passing the enemy, keeping him on your left side, and immediately thrust at him. If he starts drawing first, you should swiftly knock him back with the tsukagashira to the chest before drawing your own sword. Both of these variants are practised as kaewaza in Musō Shinden Jūshin-ryū, along with versions for dealing with two enemies.

The *Jōi no daiji* adds some rather interesting advice under the Yukichigai heading: if you notice someone behaving suspiciously outside at night, you should call out your own family name; if they have hostile intent towards you, they will respond "yes". This method is supposedly also effective during the day when you are out travelling.

The name Ryōshi-hikitsure, like Kukurisute and Katame no koto, appear after the list of kata without any further explanation in the *Battō kokoromochi no koto*.

### 追掛斬 Oikakegiri

Meaning: "pursuing and cutting"  
Traditional name: 追掛斬 *Oikakegiri*

Oikakegiri (written 遂懸切) first appears in the *Soto no mono no daiji*. It emphasises that, when pursuing an enemy, you should draw and fix the kissaki at the enemy's left eye, then run and cut him down. The reason given is that if you point your sword at his right side, he will be able to swing his sword around and sweep yours aside.

## Notes on metsuke and techniques

Due to the outsize influence of kendō on modern iaidō, in particular through ZNKR iaidō, *enzan no metsuke* (遠山の目付; "distant-mountain gaze") has become the default in iai. In solo training, it is convenient as one only has to look in the general direction of the kasōteki, past them into the distance. However, in traditional Eishin-ryū, enzan no metsuke is rarely used. Instead, in seated forms where the enemy is close, *nisei no metsuke* (二星の目付; "two-star gaze") should be employed. This name, like *enzan no metsuke*, probably comes from Shinkage-ryū and is first attested in the [Tsuki no shō](../../tsuki-no-sho/README.md). It is defined as looking at the enemy's both hands (the "two stars"), attention equally divided between them and not fixed at one point. This allows one to accurately detect the enemy's intent at a very early stage. This is not only a matter of gaze, however — in the copy of the *Soto no mono no daiji* written by the tenth headmaster Hayashi Yasudayū Masakusu, the following is explicitly stated:

>> 詰合ハ二星二ツヅマル敵之拳也二星一文字ト云時ハ敵ノコブシヲ抜拂フ事也惣而拳ヲ勝事極意也
>
> [Tsumeai](README.md#tsumeai-no-kurai) comes down to *nisei*; that is, the enemy's fists. *Nisei ichimonji* means to draw and sweep at the enemy's fists. In general, the secret is to defeat the fists.

The above quote should have particular bearing on how to interpret [Sunegakoi](#脛囲-sunegakoi) and [Kasumi](#霞-kasumi) on a deeper level, but the theme of targeting the hands goes all the way back to the Kongen no maki, where [Tsukaguchi rokusun](../msjr/iai-kongen-no-maki.md#on-the-nature-of-tsukaguchi-rokusun) is named as the ultimate secret of the school.

Returning to the topic of metsuke, *Tachi metsuke no koto* (太刀目付之㕝; "gaze in sword-fighting") in the *Battō heijutsu shinshin kanyō no daiji* describes another, rather unusual, type of metsuke. It says that when facing an opponent in a (standing) fight, one should look at the enemy's legs and feet. Two reasons are given for this: firstly, it allows one better to "know the situation" (*i.e.* judge distance, timing, and intent); secondly, it helps one stay calm in the face of danger and not be overcome by fear.

In the *Shinden-ryū iai gokuhisho*, it is stated that the essence of iai lies in thrusting techniques, but that thrusts are hidden inside the forms of daily practice; when one feels that it would be a good time to thrust, that is when one should thrust. This is surely doubly true in Okuden, and should be kept in mind during practice.

When moving from a one-handed cut into furikaburi towards another enemy in a different direction, one runs the risk of getting the tsuka stuck in the sleeve opening when wearing a regular kimono. In order to avoid this, Okuden kata employ a technique called *yukiore* (雪折; "breaking under the weight of snow"). It consists of dropping the kissaki and thereby raising the tsukagashira in the direction of the next cut, clearing it from the sleeve opening. The name conjures the image of a tree branch breaking under heavy snow; I once heard it referred to as *yanagiore* (柳折; "willow tree breaking"), which is ironic as the saying goes "the willow tree won't break under the weight of snow" (柳に雪折れなし). In the basic Musō Shinden-ryū forms, this technique applies only to Tozume and Yukizure.
