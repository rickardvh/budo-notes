## 霞 Kasumi

Meaning: "haze" or "mist"  
Traditional name: 向拂 *Mukōbarai* ("sweep/clear in front")

The name Kasumi may have borrowed from the *Soto no mono no daiji* (outside essentials), where it describes a detached, "dreamlike" state of mind, in which one perceives the enemy as through a haze. It was paired with the secret technique Raiden (雷電, "thunder and lightning") where one cuts the enemy's hand on the tsuka from jōdan as they move to attack. These two concepts are described as the innermost of the inner teachings; the very foundation of the school.

## 脛囲 Sunegakoi

Meaning: "protecting the shin"  
Traditional name: 柄留 *Tsukadome* ("stopping (with) the tsuka")

In the traditional form, one uses the tsuka to press the enemy's sword hand down and stop the draw; as they instead step back and draw from below to cut the leg, one continues as in Tora-issoku. Sunegakoi leaves the first part out, resulting in a form essentially identical to Tora-issoku.

## 四方切 Shihōgiri

Meaning: "cuts in four directions"  
Traditional name: 四角 *Shikaku* ("square"/"four corners")  
Other names: 四角 *Yosumi*, *Shisumi* ("four corners")

The name Shihōgiri appears in one of the old mokuroku directly following the core Eishin-ryū forms. It is unclear to me what exactly it refers to there, but it appears to be a small set of four kata: 向 (front), 右 (right), 左 (left), and 後 (back). The important lesson of this kata, which comes from instructions in the *Jōi no daiji* (essentials of acting on orders), is that one will not have time to cut each enemy in turn, but has to thrust to the back or back left first, and then cut the remaining three enemies in the specified order, so as to have any chance of winning.

## 戸詰 Tozume

Meaning: "caught in the door"  
Traditional name: 両詰 *Ryōzume* ("pressed on both sides")  
Other names: 三角 *Sankaku* ("triangle"/"three corners")

Originally, this form dealt with the scenario where you have an enemy close by on both sides, such as when you are sent as an envoy and the guards move to seize you. [Towaki](#戸脇-towaki) was the base form, as it is faster first to thrust to the left before cutting to the right, compared to cutting each enemy in turn. However, if you think the enemy to the right may stop you from drawing, it is prudent to cut him before turning to the one on the left: this kaewaza became Tozume.

Sankaku is another kata completely, where you have one enemy in front and two behind.

As for Tozume, the name comes from an entry in the *Jōi no daiji*, instructing on what to do if you fear the enemy might slam the sliding door shut on your head as you bow in the doorway upon entering a room; in this situation, you should place a folding fan in the door groove in the floor and hold it down with your knee while bowing, in order to block the door.

## 戸脇 Towaki

Meaning: "beside the door"  
Traditional name: 両詰 *Ryōzume* ("pressed on both sides")

See [Tozume](#戸詰-tozume).

The name Towaki again comes from the *Jōi no daiji*, where it contains instructions on how to enter a room when you suspect an enemy might be hiding to the side of the door waiting to ambush you: enter through the door with one decisive step directly towards where you think the enemy is standing, and pull the sword out together with the saya, using the tsuka to push him back with a strike to the chest, before drawing and thrusting at the staggered enemy. In the case that the enemy has already drawn his sword and cuts down the moment you enter, first block the cut with the tsuba near the fuchigane, the sword still in the saya.

## 棚下 Tanashita

Meaning: "under the shelf"  
Traditional name: 棚下 *Tanashita*

## 両詰（向詰） Ryōzume (Mukōzume)

Meaning: "pressed on both sides" (Ryōzume); "pressed in front" (Mukōzume)  
Traditional name: 向詰 *Mukōzume*

Meaning: "tiger run"  
Traditional name: 虎走 *Torabashiri*

## 連達 Tsuredachi

Meaning: "in column"  
Traditional name: 行連 *Yukizure*

## 惣捲 Sōmakuri

Meaning: "completely over and over"  
Traditional name: 五方切 *Gohōgiri* ("cuts in five directions")  
Other names: 追いかけ斬 *Oikakegiri* ("pursuing cuts")

## 総留 Sōdome

Meaning: "complete stopping"  
Traditional name: 放打 *Hanashiuchi* ("release-strike")

## 信夫 Shinobu

Meaning: ("in stealth")  
Traditional name: 夜之太刀 *Yoru no tachi* ("sword in the night")  
Other names: 夜の敵 *Yoru no teki* ("enemy in the night")

Traditional name: 連達 *Tsuredachi*
