## 霞 Kasumi

Meaning: "haze" or "mist"  
Traditional name: 向拂 *Mukōbarai* ("sweep/clear in front")

The name Kasumi may have borrowed from the *Soto no mono no daiji* (outside essentials), where it describes a detached, "dreamlike" state of mind, in which one perceives the enemy as through a haze. It was paired with the secret technique Raiden (雷電, "thunder and lightning") where one cuts the enemy's hand on the tsuka from jōdan as they move to attack. These two concepts are described as the innermost of the inner teachings; the very foundation of the school.

## 脛囲 Sunegakoi

Meaning: "protecting the shin"  
Traditional name: 柄留 *Tsukadome* ("stopping (with) the tsuka")

In the traditional form, one uses the tsuka to press the enemy's sword hand down and stop the draw; as they instead step back and draw from below to cut the leg, one continues as in Tora-issoku. Sunegakoi leaves the first part out, resulting in a form essentially identical to Tora-issoku.

## 四方切 Shihōgiri

Meaning: "cuts in four directions"  
Traditional name: 四角 *Shikaku* ("square"/"four corners")  
Other names: 四角 *Yosumi*, *Shisumi*

The name Shihōgiri appears in one of the old mokuroku directly following the core Eishin-ryū forms. It is unclear to me what exactly it refers to there, but it appears to be a small set of four kata: 向 (front), 右 (right), 左 (left), and 後 (back).

## 戸詰 Tozume

Meaning: "caught in the door"
Traditional name: 両詰 *Ryōzume* ("pressed on both sides")  
Other names: 三角 *Sankaku* ("triangle"/"three corners")

Originally, this form dealt with the scenario where you have an enemy close by on both sides, such as when you are sent as an envoy and the guards move to seize you. [Towaki](#戸脇-towaki) was the base form, as it is faster first to thrust to the left before cutting to the right, compared to cutting each enemy in turn. However, if you think the enemy to the right may stop you from drawing, it is prudent to cut him before turning to the one on the left: this kaewaza became Tozume.

Sankaku is another kata completely, where you have one enemy in front and two behind.

As for Tozume, the name comes from an entry in the *Jōi no daiji* (essentials of acting on orders), instructing on what to do if one fears the enemy might slam the sliding door shut on one's head as one bows in the doorway upon entering a room; in this situation, one should place a folding fan in the door groove in the floor and hold it down with one's knee while bowing, in order to block the door.

## 戸脇 Towaki

Traditional name: 両詰 *Ryōzume*

## 棚下 Tanashita

Traditional name: 棚下 *Tanashita*

## 両詰（向詰） Ryōzume (Mukōzume)
