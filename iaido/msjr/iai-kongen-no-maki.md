# The origins of iai　居合根元之巻

> 抑此居合ト申者日本奥州林之従大明神夢想に〆奉傳之

To begin with, this which is called iai has been reverently transmitted as revealed in a divine dream from the Great Deity of Hayashi in the Ōshū region of Japan.

> 夫兵術者上古中古雖有数多之違佗流大人小人無力剛力不嫌合兵用云々

As for martial arts, although in ancient and mediaeval times there have been many other different schools, there are methods that can be employed in battle equally by people of large or small stature, by those without strength or those with great strength, and so on and so forth.

> 末代爲相應之太刀尓云手近勝一命有無之極

In these latter days, it is said about sword arts most suitable for the current age: victory at close quarters is the ultimate line between life and death.

> 此居合恐者粟散邊土於堺不審之儀不可有之唯依㚑夢處也

Even in the remote provinces there can surely be no doubt regarding this iai, for it stems solely from divine revelation.

> 此始尋奥州林崎神助重信ト云者因有兵術望之林之明神一百有日令参籠其満暁夢中老翁重信告曰

It began with a man called Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu of Ōshū. Aspiring to mastery of the martial arts, he undertook a retreat of over one hundred days of seclusion and prayer to the Hayashi Myōjin. At the dawn of its fulfilment, an old man appeared to Shigenobu in a dream and declared thus:

> 汝以此太刀常胸中憶持者得勝怨敵云々

"If you hold this sword art always in your heart, you shall gain victory over your hated enemies."

> 則如㚑夢有得大利以腰刀三尺三寸勝九寸五分事

And so, just as in the revelation, he gained great advantage: with a sword of three shaku and three sun at his waist, he was able to defeat one of nine sun and five bu.

> 柄口六寸勝之妙不思義之極意一國一人之相傳也

The marvel of victory by six sun of the hilt-opening is an ultimate secret beyond comprehension to be transmitted only to a single person in a single land.

> 腰刀三尺三寸三毒則三部尓但脇差九寸五分九曜五古之内證也

The waist sword of three shaku three sun represents the Three Poisons, which are the Three Divisions. However, the side sword of nine sun five bu represents the Nine Luminaries and the Five-pronged Vajra – these are internal teachings.

> 敵味方成㕝是亦前生之業感也生死一體戰場浄土也

Whether someone becomes an enemy or an ally is also the result of karma from previous lives. Life and death are one; the battlefield is the Pure Land.

> 如此観則現世蒙大聖摩利支尊天加護来世成佛成縁之㕝豈有疑哉

With this view, one will receive the divine protection of the Great Sage Marishiten in this life, and be able to attain Buddhahood in the next life – how could there be any doubt?

> 此居合雖積千金不眞實之人者堅不可授之恐天罰唯授一人傳之云々

Even if someone were to offer a thousand pieces of gold, this iai must under no circumstances be taught to an insincere person. For fear of divine punishment, it must be passed on to only one person.

> 古語曰  
> 其進疾者其退速云々  
> 此意以貴賎尊卑無隔不謂前後輩達其所作者許目録印可等無相違

An old saying goes: "He who advances swiftly, also retreats swiftly." In this spirit, there shall be no distinction between noble and base, high and low rank; without regard for seniority or juniority, licenses and techniques shall be bestowed without prejudice.

> 又古語曰  
> 夫百錬之搆在則苐茨荘鄙與兵利心懸者夜白思之神明佛陀祈者則忽得利方是依心潜身事燦然

Another old saying goes: "Even in a humble thatched-roof hut in a rural village, one tempered by a hundred trials who devotes himself to refinement in the martial arts, who contemplates their principles deep into the night and prays to the gods and the Buddhas, will immediately grasp the advantageous way." By relying on one's heart and living a quiet life, one's whole being will radiate with excellence.

## Tetsugi no maki　手次之巻

The *Tetsugi no maki* (手次之巻)[^1] is a version of the scroll written by Sakai Shichiemon of Hayashizaki Tamiya-ryū in 1706 and conferred as a menkyo kaiden to Sakai Jūbei Nagateru. The scroll contains added commentary, most likely by Nagateru, in the spaces between the lines. I have numbered these notes and will be referring to them below at the place where they appear in the scroll.

## Commentary and translation notes

> 抑此居合ト申者日本奥州林之従大明神夢想に〆奉傳之

"The Great Deity of Hayashi" is rendered from 林之従大明神, which literally means "the great and bright god of Hayashi". 大明神 (*daimyōjin*) is listed in my dictionary as "deity with extraordinary spiritual powers", but 明神 was also used more specifically as an epithet for Shintō gods that were thought also to be aspects of one or more Buddhist deities in Japanese syncretism. This god was the head deity of the Hayashi area, which is synonymous to or surrounds the village of Hayashizaki, located in present-day Murayama, Yamagata. In other texts and current usage, the deity is referred to as Hayashizaki Daimyōjin. Ōshū (奥州) is the old name for the Tōhoku region of northeastern Honshū.

> 夫兵術者上古中古雖有数多之違佗流大人小人無力剛力不嫌合兵用云々

This paragraph discusses martial arts (兵術 *heijutsu*; literally military tactics or the art of war) of the past, saying that there have been many "different schools" (違佗流). This word 違佗流 (*idaryū*) is somewhat mysterious: 違 means "different", but 佗 is "proud" or "lonely". The meaning could therefore be something like "different schools, each unique and standing apart", but the wording is slightly odd. Yamakoshi Masaki-sensei of Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū has a different interpretation[^2], taking 違佗 to be a mistaken version of 韋陀 (*Ida*) as in the name of the Buddhist guardian deity Skanda (韋陀天 *Idaten*). With Idaten being a warrior deity, Yamakoshi-sensei's rendering of 韋陀流 would refer to schools either dedicated to this god or, alternatively, more generally claiming an origin in divine revelation. Idaten is usually written 韋駄天, however, so in order not to read too much into the word, I decided to translate 違佗流 simply as "different schools". Either way, the various schools are described as being employed in battle without favouring large nor small people, the strong nor the weak, "and so on" (云々 *unnun*). Note that this is the only place I have chosen to keep 云々 in the translation, as I felt it disturbed the flow more than it contributed elsewhere in English.

> 末代爲相應之太刀尓云手近勝一命有無之極

A more literal translation here would be "it is said about the sword (technique) suitable for the latter (read: current) age that victory at close range is the ultimate decider of the existence or nonexistence of life". The important point is that although there have been many and varying schools for different people and circumstances in the past, iai specialises in defeating an enemy at extremely close quarters, as this is identified as being the essential skill for the new age of swordsmanship.

> 此居合恐者粟散邊土於堺不審之儀不可有之唯依㚑夢處也

Here, 粟散邊土 (*zokusan hendo*) literally means "borderlands (like) scattered millet", referring to remote regions of Japan even at its very borders (於堺). The word is a Chinese translation of a phrase found in old Buddhist texts, where it described the more than two hundred smaller kingdoms of ancient India as like millet scattered on a plate. Although the exact wording is that there is "likely" (恐) no "matter of doubt" (不審之儀), I chose a slightly stronger wording of "surely no doubt". The message is that iai is not something created by men, but simply passed on as instructed by the gods, wherefore no one should harbour any doubt about it[^3].

> 此始尋奥州林崎神助重信ト云者因有兵術望之林之明神一百有日令参籠其満暁夢中老翁重信告曰

It is interesting to note here that Jinsuke is written here as 神助 rather than the actual name 甚助. Although it could be a simple mistake, it seems likely that the author is trying to reinforce the divine connection by using the kanji for god, 神. "At the dawn of its fulfilment" (満暁) is to be taken literally: at dawn on the final day of Shigenobu's retreat, an old man appeared to him at his bedside and passed on to him the secrets of iai.

> 汝以此太刀常胸中憶持者得勝怨敵云々

This quote from the dream ends with 云々, indicating that there was more to the message than this short sentence. As this seems fairly obvious, and it felt somewhat improper to end a quote from a deity with "and so on" in English, I left it out. In any event, this sentence was the final message in the dream, said after the old man had instructed Shigenobu in swordsmanship.

Regarding the phrase 得勝怨敵, literally "gain victory over your hated enemy", there are two possible, though not mutually exclusive, interpretations. The literal interpretation is that the revelation allowed Shigenobu to avenge his murdered father, and given that preparation for this quest was what led him to seclude himself in prayer and training in the first place, this seems more than plausible. Trenson (2014)[^1] offers a more figurative interpretation, which fits well into the esoteric theme of the scroll: 怨敵 (*onteki*) was sometimes used in esoteric Buddhist contexts to refer to the obstacles ("enemies") to enlightenment; the wordly desires or evil passions called *klesha* (煩悩 *bonnō*).

> 則如㚑夢有得大利\[1\]以腰刀三尺三寸\[2\]勝九寸五分\[3\]事
>
>> 1. 一心悟リナリ、言重信サトリタナリ
>> 2. ~~五尺二・三寸~~　ツウレイノ人ハ三尺三寸迄ハ実ノ所ヌカルヽ也
>> 3. 九寸五分ハ九寸五分ノ間合ナケレハヌケ不申トノ事

Shigenobu is stated here to have gained "great advantage" or "great benefit" (大利), and note 1 in the Tetsugi no maki explains that this means Shigenobu awakened (悟り *satori*; Buddhist enlightenment) to the "One Mind" (一心 *isshin*), a state of unity with the gods, Buddhas, and the universe.

The rest of this passage is rather straightforward: a "waist sword" three shaku and three sun (~1 m) long defeating \[a sword measuring\] nine sun and five bu (~28 cm). To an uninitiated reader, this may sound obvious; recall, however, that iai is applied at extremely close range, where the shorter sword would normally have an overwhelming advantage -- even more so considering that both swords are sheathed at the onset. In the first place, wearing such a long sword at the waist like an uchigatana would have been highly unorthodox, as it would have been very difficult to draw. Note 2 in the Tetsugi no maki adds that a person of average height (a crossed-out part specifies a height of 5 shaku 2-3 sun; ~160 cm) should be able to draw a sword of 3 shaku 3 sun, with the implication that this is the maximum length that can be drawn from the waist by a person of that height.

Note 3 says that the short sword of 9 sun 5 bu can only be drawn at the range of 9 sun 5 bu. The wording seems to refer to the effective range (間合 *ma-ai*) of the short sword rather than the exact distance. Rephrasing, then, the short sword can only be drawn at its own effective range.

> 柄口六寸\[4\]勝之妙不思義之極意一國一人\[5\]之相傳也
>
>> 4. ウケ處ヨリ六寸ハナレ柄手出サル処、則九寸五分ニ勝ナリ
>> 5. トハ重信ヲ云ナリ

This term 柄口六寸 (*tsukaguchi rokusun*) literally means "hilt-opening six sun" (~18 cm), but I will henceforth refer to it by its Japanese name. It is clearly *the* ultimate secret of the school, but the word itself is rather mysterious. Unfortunately, the true meaning of tsukaguchi rokusun appears to have been mostly forgotten within the Tosa line, so unless it has been preserved in Shin-Musō Hayashizaki-ryū, we can only speculate based on scattered references in other extant scrolls (more on this later). The Tetsugi no maki adds in note 4 that the phrase refers to a point six sun away from the "receiving point" (ウケ處 *ukedokoro*; the target of the attack?) before the hand has started to move forwards.

"One person in one land" (一國一人) is clarified in note 5 as referring to Shigenobu himself, meaning he was the only recipient of the revelation in all of Japan.

> 腰刀三尺三寸三毒\[6\]則三部\[7\]尓但脇差九寸五分九曜\[8\]五古\[9\]之内證也
>
>> 6. ナメクシリ・ヒツキ・ヘミ也、又曰、~~ウタカイハ~~ マヨウハ酒色ヨクノミツ成、又イロヽヽモウネ念ヲサレト也、三毒ノアラソイニタトヱ、ニクムナナケレトノヲシヘナリ

>> 8. 星ナリ
>> 9. シン？天タイニ有、ソウレイノ致ニ付、コレヲナラス、死ヲイサキヨクチウフツセヨトナリ、一心ノケツタンノ事ナリ、九寸五分ニ至本也

Here, the author explains the symbolism behind the measurements of the two swords. The Tetsugi no maki contains several explanatory notes, as well as a separate section on the Three Poisons and Three Divisions.

The Three Poisons (三毒 *sandoku*) in Buddhism are the three root *kleshas*; the character flaws that cause suffering and keep souls trapped in the cycle of rebirth. They are: Attachment (*rāga*; also Desire or Greed), Aversion (*dveṣa*; also Anger or Hatred), and Delusion (*moha*; also Ignorance). Note 6 expounds upon the Three Poisons, associating them with slugs, toads, and snakes. It then goes on to say that a wavering mind falls to alcohol, lust, and greed, and that the teachings admonish against hatred by likening the struggle against delusions to that against the Three Poisons.

According to note 7, the "Three Divisions" (三部 *sanbu*) refer to three of the Five Buddha Families; specifically, the three associated with the Three Poisons. These three, as explained in the Tetsugi no maki, are: the Vajra family (containing Fudō, Idaten, Marishiten, and various other martial Buddhas), the Buddha family (containing, among others, the Amida Buddha), and the Lotus (*Padma*) family (containing the Nyorai Buddhas, representing purity). Note 7 continues by saying that by overcoming the Three Poisons, one may reach a state of formlessness (無形 *mukei*). "Formlessness" here refers to a state of enlightenment where one is not bound by physical or mental form.

Regarding the Nine Luminaries (九曜 *kuyō*), there is only a short comment (note 8) saying "these are celestial bodies", but the term refers to the so-called Navagraha of Hindu mythology. They are the Sun and the Moon, the five classical planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), and Rahu and Ketu, the ascending and descending nodes of the Moon. In Hindu astrology, these nine (or their deific personifications) were thought to be able to influence the lives of humans.

The five-pronged vajra is a ritual tool or weapon, representing the indestructibility of diamond and the power of a thunderbolt, in Buddhism and Hinduism. Here, the word used for the vajra is 五古 (*goko*), which literally translates to "five ancients"; however, the second character 古 is mistaken (or ateji) and should be 鈷. The vajra is always used together with the bell in Buddhist rituals. Note 9[^4] explains that "it" (the bell/vajra) is rung at funerals, and that the ringing urges the deceased to pass on peacefully into death and ascend to Buddhahood, as well as symbolising their determination to achieve the One Mind. This is the basis of the nine sun and five bu.

The final clause states that these symbolic meanings are internal teachings (内證) -- the literal translation is closer to "internal certification/verification", so this implies that this secret knowledge could be used within the school to verify licenses.

> 敵味方成㕝是亦前生之業感也\[10\]生死一體\[11\]戰場浄土\[12\]也
>
>> 10. 無ヨリ出テ無ニカヱテ生死大々一タイナリコヽヲサトリ
>> 11. 死スルハ我一人ノケツタンセヨト也、為儀与志死ネト申ナリ
>> 12. 生テ人前ニ顔ノムケラレヌヨリハシヽテコクラクト思ヘト也

Note 10 expands upon the idea of karma from past lives determining whether someone becomes an ally of an enemy, saying: this is the realisation that everything comes from emptiness and returns to emptiness, wherefore life and death form one great whole.

In note 11, the commentator says that dying must be only one's own resolve, and that this means one must (be prepared to) die for honour/justice (儀 *gi*) or ambition (志 *shi*). 儀 really means "ceremony" or "matter", but I surmise it is used here instead of 義, meaning "honour", "righteousness", or "justice". Trenson (2014)[^1] renders it as "propriety". 志 is "volition", "intention", or "resolve", so "ambition" seems like an apt translation in this context.

On the topic of the battlefield being the Pure Land, note 12 explains that rather than living on in dishonour and shame, it is better to die and think of it as paradise.

> 如此観則現世蒙大聖摩利支尊天\[13\]加護来世成佛成縁之㕝豈有疑哉
>
>> 13. 如此ノ志テコソ神佛モカコアルヘシナリ、生ヲウル事アルヘシトノ事ナリ

Note 13 adds that the gods (probably mainly referring to deified mortals) and Buddhas, too, had the same resolve in the past, and that the passage means that one will be granted life after death.

> 此居合雖積千金\[14\]不眞實之人\[15\]者堅不可授之恐天罰\[16\]唯授一人\[17\]傳之云々
>
>> 14. 得タル処千金ニモトメタトイハレテモユルスヘキヨウナキナリ
>> 15. 儀を不知、先ノ趣ニ不合ニ、三毒ノ道理ヲワキマヱヌ者ニ免スナトナリ
>> 16. 其人悪ヲナセハ我モハチナリ、天ハツト知ヘシ
>> 17. 前條ノ趣ヨクソナハリタル人ヲ云

Even if someone were to offer a thousand pieces of gold, this iai must under no circumstances be taught to an insincere person. For fear of divine punishment, it must be passed on to only one person.

> 古語曰  
> 其進疾者其退速云々  
> 此意以貴賎尊卑無隔不謂前後輩達其所作者許目録印可等無相違

An old saying goes: "He who advances swiftly, also retreats swiftly." In this spirit, there shall be no distinction between noble and base, high and low rank; without regard for seniority or juniority, licenses and techniques shall be bestowed without prejudice.

This paragraph is not included in the Tetsugi no maki; perhaps it was added later.

> 又古語曰  
> 夫百錬之搆在則苐茨荘鄙\[18\]與兵利心懸者夜白思之神明佛陀祈者則忽得利方是依心潜身事燦然
>
>> 18. 明心ヲウルノトコロニテ筆紙ノヘカタシ

Another old saying goes: "Even in a humble thatched-roof hut in a rural village, one tempered by a hundred trials who devotes himself to refinement in the martial arts, who contemplates their principles deep into the night and prays to the gods and the Buddhas, will immediately grasp the advantageous way." By relying on one's heart and living a quiet life, one's whole being will radiate with excellence.

## About Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu

Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu was born Asano Tamimaru (浅野民丸) or possibly Tamiharu (民治). The revelation happened in the fifth month of the 23rd year of the Tenmon era (1554), when Tamimaru was 13 years old. Upon turning 14 the following year, he changed his name to Hayashizaki to honour the deity, and took the adult names of Jinsuke and Shigenobu in honour of his father. Jinsuke was his father's childhood name, and Shigenari (重成), in which Shigenobu changed the second kanji, the father's adult name.

[^3]: The logical leap of thinking the claim of divine revelation would be *less* cause for doubt amuses me greatly: "A god told this to me in a dream!" -- "Oh, all right then, then it must be legit."
[^4]: The first clause of note 9 says that something "is in the celestial bodies" (connecting to the Nine Luminaries), but the last character of the first word is illegible. Trenson (2014) guesses that it should be "humans", and it could refer to the fate of human lives.
