To begin with, this which is called iai was received in a divine dream from Hayashi Daimyōjin in Ōshū, Japan.

Now, as for martial arts, though in ancient and mediaeval times there have been many other different schools, this art can be employed without discrimination between people of large or small stature, by those without strength or those with great strength, and so on and so forth.

In these latter days, it is considered a sword art most suitable for the current age. It is said: victory at close quarters is the ultimate decider of life and death.

Regarding this iai, there should be no matter of doubt concerning its provenance: it stems solely from a divine dream.

It began with a man called Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu of Ōshū. Aspiring to mastery of the martial arts, he undertook a retreat of over one hundred days of seclusion and prayer to the Hayashi Myōjin. At the dawn of its fulfilment, an old man appeared to Shigenobu in a dream and declared thus:

"If you always keep this sword art in your heart, you shall gain victory over your hated enemies."

And so, just as in the divine dream, he gained great benefit: with a sword of three shaku and three sun at his waist, he was able to defeat one of nine sun and five bu. The marvel of victory six sun from the hilt is an incredible ultimate secret to be transmitted only to a single person in a single country.

The waist sword of three shaku three sun represents the Three Poisons; that is, the Three Divisions. However, the side sword of nine sun five bu represents the Nine Luminaries and the Five Wisdoms -- these are internal teachings.

Becoming an enemy or an ally is also the result of karma from previous lives. Life and death are indivisible; the battlefield is the Pure Land. With this view, one will receive the divine protection of the Great Sage Marishiten in this life, and be able to attain Enlightenment in the next life –- how could there be any doubt?

Even if someone were to offer a thousand pieces of gold, this iai must absolutely not be taught to an insincere person. For fear of divine punishment, it must be transmitted to a sole successor.

An old saying goes: "He who advances swiftly, also retreats swiftly." In this spirit, there shall be no distinction between noble and base, high and low rank; without regard for seniority or juniority, licenses and techniques shall be granted without prejudice.

Another old saying goes: "With a determination forged a hundred times, even in a humble thatched-roof hut in a rural village, one who devotes himself to the art of war and prays earnestly to the gods and the Buddhas at night, will immediately gain insight." When one devotes oneself wholeheartedly, one's whole being becomes brilliantly clear.
