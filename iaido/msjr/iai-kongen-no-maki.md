# The origins of iai　居合根元之巻

> 抑此居合ト申者日本奥州林之従大明神夢想に〆奉傳之

To begin with, this which is called iai has been reverently transmitted as revealed in a divine dream from the Great Deity of Hayashi in the Ōshū region of Japan.

> 夫兵術者上古中古雖有数多之違佗流大人小人無力剛力不嫌合兵用云々

As for martial arts, although in ancient and mediaeval times there have been many other different schools, there are methods that can be employed in battle equally by people of large or small stature, by those without strength or those with great strength, and so on and so forth.

> 末代爲相應之太刀尓云手近勝一命有無之極

In these latter days, it is said about sword arts most suitable for the current age: victory at close quarters is the ultimate line between life and death.

> 此居合恐者粟散邊土於堺不審之儀不可有之唯依㚑夢處也

Even in faraway lands there can surely be no doubt regarding this iai, for it stems solely from divine revelation.

> 此始尋奥州林崎神助重信ト云者因有兵術望之林之明神一百有日令参籠其満暁夢中老翁重信告曰

It began with a man called Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu of Ōshū. Aspiring to mastery of the martial arts, he undertook a retreat of over one hundred days of seclusion and prayer to the Hayashi Myōjin. At the dawn of its fulfilment, an old man appeared to Shigenobu in a dream and declared thus:

> 汝以此太刀常胸中憶持者得勝怨敵云々

"If you hold this sword art always in your heart, you shall gain victory over your hated enemies."

> 則如㚑夢有得大利以腰刀三尺三寸勝九寸五分事

And so, just as in the revelation, he gained great advantage: with a sword of three shaku and three sun at his waist, he was able to defeat one of nine sun and five bu.

> 柄口六寸勝之妙不思義之極意一國一人之相傳也

The marvel of victory by six sun of the hilt-opening is an ultimate secret beyond comprehension to be transmitted only to a single person in a single land.

> 腰刀三尺三寸三毒則三部尓但脇差九寸五分九曜五古之内證也

The waist sword of three shaku three sun represents the Three Poisons, which are the Three Divisions. However, the side sword of nine sun five bu represents the Nine Luminaries and the Five-pronged Vajra – these are internal teachings.

> 敵味方成㕝是亦前生之業感也生死一體戰場浄土也

Whether someone becomes an enemy or an ally is also the result of karma from previous lives. Life and death are one; the battlefield is the Pure Land.

> 如此観則現世蒙大聖摩利支尊天加護来世成佛成縁之㕝豈有疑哉

With this view, one will receive the divine protection of the Great Sage Marishiten in this life, and be able to attain Buddhahood in the next life – how could there be any doubt?

> 此居合雖積千金不眞實之人者堅不可授之恐天罰唯授一人傳之云々

Even if someone were to offer a thousand pieces of gold, this iai must under no circumstances be taught to an insincere person. For fear of divine punishment, it must be passed on to only one person.

> 古語曰  
> 其進疾者其退速云々  
> 此意以貴賎尊卑無隔不謂前後輩達其所作者許目録印可等無相違

An old saying goes: "He who advances swiftly, also retreats swiftly." In this spirit, there shall be no distinction between noble and base, high and low rank; without regard for seniority or juniority, licenses and techniques shall be bestowed without prejudice.

> 又古語曰  
> 夫百錬之搆在則苐茨荘鄙與兵利心懸者夜白思之神明佛陀祈者則忽得利方是依心潜身事燦然

Another old saying goes: "Even in a humble thatched-roof hut in a rural village, one tempered by a hundred trials who devotes himself to refinement in the martial arts, who contemplates their principles deep into the night and prays to the gods and the Buddhas, will immediately grasp the advantageous way." By relying on one's heart and living a quiet life, one's whole being will radiate with excellence.
