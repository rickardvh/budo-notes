## Commentary and translation notes

Although many of the names under the "essentials" headings will look familiar to practitioners of Musō Shinden-ryū and Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū, they are, in fact, not (yet) kata as such. Rather, they are instructions for how to act in different situations, as will become clear in later scrolls.

[^1]: This heading is listed slightly differently from the others, and seems to be neither a section under Forms nor a completely separate heading, as it is written lower than the surrounding headings almost so as to fit in with the preceding section.

[^2]: This one is left out from another version of the scroll.

[^3]: The character 鈠 does not occur in standard Japanese usage, and its reading in this context is uncertain. It is a [rare Chinese character](https://dict.variants.moe.edu.tw/dictView.jsp?ID=106643) denoting a type of small spear. By analogy, the likely kun’yomi would be ほこ (*hoko*), and the on’yomi エキ/ヤク (*eki*/*yaku*). However, it may also have been used here as a variant or scribal substitution for 鍛 (*kitae*), meaning "to forge" or "to strengthen".  
鈠 has since been dropped from the kata name, which is now simply 骨防, variously read as *Koppō*, *Kobbō*, or *Kotsubō*. On the face of it, *Kotsubō* seems like the most likely reading, but *Koppō* appears to be the most common in Shimomura-ha lineages, wherefore I have chosen to go with that.

[^4]: The actual character used here is an old shorthand variant. It is included in Unicode extension block B with the character point U+20B0B, but cannot be rendered in common fonts.
