## Commentary and translation notes

Although many of the names under the "essentials" headings will look familiar to practitioners of Musō Shinden-ryū and Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū, they are, in fact, not (yet) kata as such. Rather, they are instructions for how to act in different situations, as will become clear in later scrolls.

What is now known as the Tachi uchi no kurai (太刀打の位, "sword-striking set") is listed as Tachiai no kurai (立合之位), meaning something more like "the standing set". Given that all other sets are (at least predominantly) seated, the naming makes more sense.

Daishōzume no kurai has not yet been split into Daishōzume and Daishō tachizume, but is listed under one heading.

[^1]: The kanji clearly say *Yamashita*, but since the kata is called Yamaoroshi (山颪) now, I have assumed this reading.

[^2]: This heading is listed slightly differently from the others, and seems to be neither a section under Forms nor a completely separate heading, as it is written lower than the surrounding headings almost so as to fit in with the preceding section.

[^3]: This one is left out from another version of the scroll.

[^4]: The character 鈠, a [rare Chinese character](https://dict.variants.moe.edu.tw/dictView.jsp?ID=106643) denoting a type of small spear, does not occur in standard Japanese usage. However, it appears to be been used here as a variant or scribal substitution for 扱 (*atsuka(u)*), meaning "to handle" or "to deal with". Soda-sensei put the name as 骨防扱 and the reading as ホネモギアツカヒ (*honemogiatsukai*), so I have treated this as authoritative. This makes 防, too, a substitute for 捥 (*mogi*, "to come off"; "to be broken"; "to bend the wrist"), so the original name was 骨捥扱.  
鈠/扱 has since been dropped from the kata name, which is now simply 骨防, usually read as *Koppō* or *Kobbō*.

[^5]: Or *yanmagaeshi*.

[^6]: Or possibly *Auishigure* (which would have been pronounced *Ōishigure*) or *Aiishigure*.

[^7]: My first instinct was to read this as *Homurakaze*, but Soda-sensei left a note above the name saying it should be read *Kasonkaze*.

[^8]: The actual character used here is an old shorthand variant. It is included in Unicode extension block B with the character point U+20B0B, but cannot be rendered in common fonts.
