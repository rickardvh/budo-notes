# Ipponme

Uchidachi assumes *morote-hidari-jōdan no kamae* stepping forwards with the left foot; shidachi, remaining in place, raises the sword above their head to assume *morote-migi-jōdan no kamae*. Both sides advance into *issoku-ittō no ma-ai*. Uchidachi, taking a large step forwards on the right foot, makes a large cut to shidachi's shōmen. In order to evade the cut, shidachi steps back leading with the left foot while pulling the hands back above the head to avoid the left hand getting cut. Uchidachi, cutting air, continues the cut all the way through to slightly below gedan height, inclining the upper body somewhat. Shidachi immediately follows with a cut to uchidachi's shōmen while stepping forwards with the right foot to complete *men-nuki-men*.

Uchidachi, keeping the sword in gedan, straightens up and takes a small step back with okuri-ashi, so shidachi, applying pressure with strong *kigurai*, lowers their kensen to between uchidachi's eyes. As uchidachi takes another step back with okuri-ashi, shidachi steps forwards with the left foot to assume hidari-jōdan to display *zanshin*.

When uchidachi starts raising their kensen, shidachi steps back again with the left foot and lowers their kensen, so the swords meet in the chūdan awase position. Both sides lower their kensen to release their kamae, and return to their respective starting position.

## Learning objective

On the face of it, this kata is pretty strange, and immediately prompts two questions:

- Why does shidachi start in migi-jōdan, which is not considered a real kamae?
- Why does uchidachi lean forwards in their cut, thereby breaking their posture?

Surely, if the main objective of the kata were to teach men-nuki-men, shidachi would use a proper fighting kamae, and uchidachi would do a normal cut in order for the scenario to be more realistic. However, as [previously discussed](preface.md), the main purpose of the first three kata is not to teach specific techniques, but to reinforce basic principles of kendō. In the case of ipponme, the objective is for the student to learn proper ma-ai, or judgement of distance. With this knowledge, let us examine the "peculiar" points from the perspective of teaching ma-ai.

### Why migi-jōdan?

Migi-jōdan is not normally considered to be an actual kamae, the reason being that the reach is not long enough to justify exposing the whole body by raising the sword above the head. It is best seen as a position of furikaburi, the sword raised above the head in preparation for a cut. The closest to a right-foot-forwards version of jōdan no kamae would be one with the hand positions swapped; a sort of left-handed jōdan. So why does the very first kata start with shidachi, the student, in migi-jōdan?

In the first place, why does uchidachi start in hidari-jōdan? Well, during regular practice, students are taught to determine proper issoku-ittō no ma-ai (the one-step cutting distance) by crossing swords in ai-chūdan (mutual chūdan). By instead raising the sword into jōdan, the teacher removes this measuring tool from the student, forcing them to judge distance without any help.

As for shidachi, by having them start in a position with the sword already above their head, not only does the teacher remove the other available measuring stick, but also abstracts away unnecessary parts of the kata. Since the objective is to learn to judge the reach of the opponent in issoku-ittō no ma-ai, the student can then fully focus on that instead of getting distracted by what to do with the sword. There is also the more material consideration of the sword getting in the way for uchidachi if shidachi were in chūdan instead. 

### Why lean forwards?
