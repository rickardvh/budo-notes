Preface to the Shintō Musō-ryū bōjutsu  
With articles

> 將刀鎗相闘者古今共及殺害故恐叨用之

When swords and spears are crossed in combat, from ancient times to the present it has always led to killing. For that reason, people feared to use them recklessly.

> 將夫棍棒者雖傷人亦隕其命者鮮矣是以世人日用爲竒仗且一取其勝利也却優於刀鎗等術也

The staff, though it may wound, rarely takes a life. Thus, people of the world commonly rely upon it as a trusty weapon, and by it attain victory. Indeed, it excels over the arts of the sword and spear.

> 古者以棒爲藝中魁首其手足攻擊之法不能外于此也宜哉

In former times, the staff was regarded as foremost among martial arts. The methods of striking at the hands and legs fall entirely within its principles; none lie beyond them. How fitting this is!

> 爰天眞正七代之弟子夢想權之助以棒術鳴世名聲籍甚矣

Now, there was in the seventh generation of the Tenshinshō lineage a disciple named Musō Gonnosuke. Through his mastery of the staff he made his name resound throughout the world, and his fame was exceedingly great.

> 或夜夢會于神童傳於棒術之奥儀夢覺乃按之則一打一揭宛然在手中焉

One night, in a dream, he encountered a divine youth who imparted to him the inner mysteries of the staff art. When he awoke and put them to the test, the forms of striking and of lifting revealed themselves clearly, as though already within his hands.

> 於是終爲一家之秘術權之助自号夢想比故也欽哉

Thus, in the end, he brought the teaching to perfection, and it became the secret art of a single household. Gonnosuke styled himself “Musō” for this reason. Joyous indeed!

> 傳術誓書授受

Thus the art is transmitted — sworn in writing, and exchanged between teacher and disciple.
